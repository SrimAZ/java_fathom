Independent Accountants' Report


The Board of Directors
Countrywide Financial Corporation:

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Management
Assertion, that Countrywide Financial Corporation and subsidiaries, including
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. ("CHL"), and
Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CHL,
(collectively, the "Company") complied with the minimum servicing standards set
forth in the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's Uniform Single
Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (USAP) as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005.  Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with
those minimum servicing standards.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management's assertion about the Company's compliance based on our
examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's
compliance with the minimum servicing standards specified above and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We
believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that Countrywide Financial Corporation
and subsidiaries, including its wholly-owned subsidiary, Countrywide Home Loans,
Inc. ("CHL"), and Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CHL, complied with the aforementioned minimum servicing standards
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material

We have examined PHH Mortgage Corporation's (the "Company") compliance with its
established minimum servicing standards described in the accompanying
Management's Assertion, dated February 28, 2006, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005. Management is responsible for compliance with those minimum
servicing standards. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants as adopted
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with its
minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company's compliance with its minimum servicing
standards.

Our examination disclosed the following instance of material noncompliance with
the reconciliation of custodial bank accounts applicable to the Company during

In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described in the preceding

Report on Management's Assertion on Compliance
with the Specified Minimum Servicing Standards Set Forth in the
Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers


Report of Independent Accountants


The Board of Directors
Waterfield Mortgage Company, Incorporated


We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying report
titled Report of Management, that Waterfield Mortgage Company, Incorporated and
Subsidiaries (the Company) complied with the servicing standards identified in
Exhibit A to the Report of Management (the "specified minimum servicing
standards") as set forth in the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's
Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (USAP) during the year
ended December 31, 2005. Management is responsible for the Company's compliance
with those specified minimum servicing standards. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assertions about the Company's compliance
based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance
with the specified minimum servicing standards and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does
not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the specified
minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion, that the Company complied with the
aforementioned specified minimum servicing standards during the year ended
December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects.
