PART I


Item 1.   Business
          --------
          The Company,  founded in 1807,  was  incorporated  in the state of New
          York on January 15,  1904.  (As used herein the term  "Company"  means
          John  Wiley  &  Sons,   Inc.,  and  its  subsidiaries  and  affiliated
          companies, unless the context indicates otherwise.)

          The Company is a global  publisher of print and  electronic  products,
          providing   content  and  solutions  to  customers   worldwide.   Core
          businesses  produce  professional  and consumer books and subscription
          products; scientific,  technical, and medical journals, encyclopedias,
          books, and online products;  and textbooks and educational  materials,
          including  integrated  online  teaching  and learning  resources,  for
          undergraduate and graduate  students,  teachers and lifelong learners.
          The Company  takes full  advantage  of its content from all three core
          businesses in developing and  cross-marketing  products to its diverse
          customer base of professionals,  consumers, researchers, students, and
          educators.  The use of  technology  enables  the  Company  to make its
          content more accessible to its customers around the world. The Company
          maintains  publishing,  marketing,  and  distribution  centers  in the
          United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

          Further  description of the Company's business is incorporated  herein
          by reference in the  Management's  Discussion and Analysis  section of
          this 10-K.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors
          ------------

          This section  describes  the major  business  risks to the Company and
          should be carefully considered.

          Cautionary  Statement Under the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform
          Act of 1995:

          This 10-K and our Annual  Report to  Shareholders  for the year ending
          April 30,  2006 report  contains  certain  forward-looking  statements
          concerning  the  Company's  operations,   performance,  and  financial
          condition.   In  addition,   the  Company   provides   forward-looking
          statements in other  materials  released to the public as well as oral
          forward-looking  information.   Statements  which  contain  the  words
          anticipate,  expect,  believes,  estimate,  project,  forecast,  plan,
          outlook,  intend and similar  expressions  constitute  forward-looking
          statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Reliance should not be
          placed on  forward-looking  statements,  as actual  results may differ
          materially from those in any forward-looking statements.

          Any  such  forward-looking  statements  are  based  upon a  number  of
          assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to uncertainties
          and  contingencies,  many of  which  are  beyond  the  control  of the
          Company,  and are subject to change based on many  important  factors.
          Such  factors  include,  but  are not  limited  to (i)  the  level  of
          investment in new technologies and products;  (ii) subscriber  renewal
          rates for the Company's  journals;  (iii) the financial  stability and
          liquidity of journal  subscription  agents;  (iv) the consolidation of
          book  wholesalers  and retail  accounts;  (v) the market  position and
          financial stability of key online retailers;  (vi) the seasonal nature
          of the Company's  educational business and the impact of the used-book
          market; (vii) worldwide economic and political conditions;  and (viii)
          the Company's ability to protect its copyrights and other intellectual
          property  worldwide  (ix) other factors  detailed from time to time in
          the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
          Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to  update  or  revise  any  such
          forward-looking   statements   to   reflect   subsequent   events   or
          circumstances.


          Operating Costs and Expenses

          The Company has a  significant  investment,  and cost, in its employee
          base around the world.  The Company  offers  competitive  salaries and
          benefits in order to attract and retain the highly  skilled  workforce
          needed to sustain and develop new products  and services  required for
          growth.  Employment  and benefit  costs are  affected  by  competitive
          market  conditions  for  qualified  individuals,  and factors  such as
          healthcare,  pension and retirement  benefits costs.  The Company is a
          large paper  purchaser,  and paper prices may fluctuate  significantly
          from  time-to-time.  The Company  attempts to moderate the exposure to
          fluctuations in price by entering into multi-year supply contracts and
          having  alternative  suppliers  available.  In general,  however,  any
          significant  increase in the costs of goods and  services  provided to
          the Company may adversely affect the Company's costs of operation.


          Protection of Intellectual Property Rights

          Substantially  all of the  Company's  publications  are  protected  by
          copyright,  held  either  in the  Company's  name,  in the name of the
          author  of the  work,  or in the name of the  sponsoring  professional
          society.  Such  copyrights  protect the Company's  exclusive  right to
          publish the work in the United States and in many countries abroad for
          specified periods,  in most cases the author's life plus 70 years, but
          in any event a minimum of 28 years for works  published  prior to 1978
          and 50 years  for  works  published  thereafter.  The  ability  of the
          Company to continue to achieve its expected results depends,  in part,
          upon the  Company's  ability  to  protect  its  intellectual  property
          rights.  The  Company's  results may be adversely  affected by lack of
          legal and/or technological  protections for its intellectual  property
          in some jurisdictions and markets.

<PAGE>

          Maintaining the Company's Reputation

          Professionals  worldwide rely upon many of the Company's  publications
          to perform their jobs. It is imperative that the Company  consistently
          demonstrates  its ability to maintain the integrity of the information
          included in its publications. Adverse publicity, whether or not valid,
          may reduce demand for the Company's publications.


          Trade Concentration and Credit Risk

          Although,  the book  publishing  industry is concentrated in national,
          regional,  and online bookstore chains,  the Company's business is not
          dependent upon a single  customer.  No one book customer  accounts for
          more than 7% of total consolidated revenue. The top 10 book customers,
          however,  account for approximately 25% of total consolidated  revenue
          and approximately  46% of total gross trade accounts  receivable as of
          April 30, 2006.

          In the journal  publishing  business,  subscriptions are often sourced
          through journal  subscription agents who, acting as agents for library
          customers,   facilitate  ordering  and  consolidate  the  subscription
          orders/billings  with various publishers.  Subscription agents account
          for approximately 17% of total consolidated  subscription  revenue and
          no one agent accounts for more than 7% of total consolidated  revenue.
          Subscription agents generally collect cash in advance from subscribers
          and remit payments to journal publishers, including the Company, prior
          to the commencement of the subscriptions. While at fiscal year-end the
          Company had  minimal  credit risk  exposure  to these  agents,  future
          calendar-year  subscription  receipts  from  these  agents  may depend
          significantly  on their financial  condition and liquidity.  Insurance
          for payment on these  accounts  is not  commercially  feasible  and/or
          available.


          Changes in Regulation and Accounting Standards

          The Company maintains  publishing,  marketing and distribution centers
          in Asia, Australia,  Canada, Europe and the United States. The conduct
          of our  business,  including  the  sourcing of content,  distribution,
          sales,  marketing  and  advertising  is subject  to  various  laws and
          regulations  administered by governments around the world.  Changes in
          laws,   regulations  or  government   policies,   including   taxation
          requirements  and  accounting  standards,  may  adversely  affect  the
          Company's future financial results.


          Introduction of New Technologies or Products

          Media and publishing companies exist in rapidly changing technological
          and competitive environments.  Therefore, the Company must continue to
          invest in  technological  and other  innovations and adapt in order to
          continue  to add  value  to  its  products  and  services  and  remain
          competitive.  There are uncertainties whenever developing new products
          and  services,  and it is often  possible  that such new  products and
          services may not be launched or if launched,  may not be profitable or
          as  profitable  as existing  products and  services.

<PAGE>

          Competition for Market Share and Author Relationships

          The  Company  operates  in highly  competitive  markets.  Success  and
          continued  growth  depends  greatly on developing new products and the
          means to deliver them in an environment of rapid technological change.
          Attracting new authors and retaining our existing author relationships
          are also  critical  to our  success.  We believe  the  Company is well
          positioned to meet these business  challenges with the strength of our
          brands, our reputation and innovative abilities.


          Effects of Inflation and Cost Increases

          The Company, from time to time, experiences cost increases reflecting,
          in part, general inflationary  factors. To mitigate the effect of cost
          increases,  the Company may take various steps to reduce  development,
          production and  manufacturing  costs. In addition,  the selling prices
          for  our  products  may  be   selectively   increased  as  marketplace
          conditions permit.


          Attracting and Retaining Key Employees

          The Company's  success is highly  dependent  upon the retention of key
          employees globally.  In addition, we are dependent upon our ability to
          continue  to attract  new  employees  with key  skills to support  the
          continued organic growth of the business.

                Management's Discussion and Analysis of Business,
                  Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The Company is a global  publisher of print and electronic  products,  providing
content  and  solutions  to  customers   worldwide.   Core  businesses   produce
professional   and  consumer  books  and  subscription   products;   scientific,
technical, and medical journals, encyclopedias,  books, and online products; and
textbooks and educational  materials,  including  integrated online teaching and
learning  resources,  for  undergraduate  and  graduate  students,  teachers and
lifelong  learners.  The Company  takes full  advantage  of its content from all
three core businesses in developing and cross-marketing  products to its diverse
customer base of professionals, consumers, researchers, students, and educators.
The use of technology enables the Company to make its content more accessible to
its customers around the world. The Company maintains publishing, marketing, and
distribution centers in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Business  growth  comes  from a  combination  of  title,  imprint  and  business
acquisitions  which  complement  the  Company's  existing  businesses;  from the
development of new products and services;  from designing and  implementing  new
methods of  delivering  products to our  customers;  and from organic  growth of
existing brands and titles.


Core Businesses
- ---------------

Professional/Trade:

The Company's Professional/Trade business acquires, develops and publishes books
and  subscription  products  in all media,  in the  subject  areas of  business,
technology,  architecture,  hospitality  and  culinary,  psychology,  education,
travel,  consumer  reference,  and general interest.  Products are developed for
worldwide  distribution  through multiple  channels,  including major chains and
online   booksellers,    independent   bookstores,   libraries,   colleges   and
universities,  warehouse clubs,  corporations,  direct marketing, and Web sites.
Global  Professional/Trade  publishing  accounted for approximately 43% of total
Company revenue in fiscal year 2006.

Key revenue growth strategies of the Professional/Trade  business include adding
value  to its  content,  developing  its  leading  brands  and  franchises,  and
executing   strategic   acquisitions.   Revenue  for  the  Company's   worldwide
Professional/Trade  business grew at a compound annual rate of approximately 18%
over the past five years.

Publishing  alliances  and  franchise  products  are  central  to the  Company's
strategy.  The Company's ability to bring together Wiley's product  development,
sales, marketing,  distribution and technological  capabilities with a partner's
content and brand name  recognition  has been a driving  factor in its  success.
Professional/Trade  alliance  partners include General Mills,  MTV, the Culinary
Institute of America, the American Medical  Association,  the American Institute
of Architects,  Mergent, Inc., the National Restaurant  Association  Educational
Foundation,  the  Leader  to Leader  Institute  (formerly  The Peter F.  Drucker
Foundation) and Morningstar, among many others.

The Company's  Professional/Trade  customers are professionals,  consumers,  and
students  worldwide.   Highly  respected  brands  and  extensive  backlists  are
especially  well suited for online  bookstores  such as  Amazon.com.  With their
unlimited  "virtual"  shelf space,  online  retailers  merchandise the Company's
products for longer periods of time than brick-and-mortar bookstores.

The Company promotes an active and growing  Professional/Trade custom publishing
program.  Custom  publications are typically used by organizations  for internal
promotional or incentive programs. Books are specifically written for a customer
or an existing Professional/Trade  publication can be customized, such as having
the cover art include custom imprint,  messages or slogans.  Of special note are
customized For Dummies publications, which leverage the power of this well-known
brand to meet the specific  information  needs of a wide range of  organizations
around the world.

<PAGE>

Key Acquisitions: The Company's business plan includes organic growth as well as
growth through acquisitions. Key strategic Professional/Trade  acquisitions over
the past five years include:  (i) In fiscal year 2006, the publishing  assets of
Sybex,  Inc.,  a  leading  publisher  to  the  global   information   technology
professional community for nearly 30 years. Sybex published about 100 new titles
a year and  maintained  a backlist  of over 450  titles in digital  photography,
operating systems,  programming and gaming categories. (ii) In fiscal year 2003,
a list of approximately  250 titles from Prentice Hall Direct, a unit of Pearson
Education.  These titles include a collection of practical,  "hands-on" teaching
resources,  which complement the Company's renowned Jossey-Bass education series
and its market-leading  Janice Van Cleave series. (iii) In fiscal year 2002, the
Company  acquired  Hungry Minds Inc., a leading  publisher  with an  outstanding
collection  of  respected  brands,  with such  product  lines as the For Dummies
series,  the Frommer's and Unofficial Guide travel series,  the Bible and Visual
technology   series,   the  CliffsNotes   study  guides,   Webster's  New  World
dictionaries,  and Betty Crocker and Weight Watchers  cookbooks.  (iv) In fiscal
year 2002,  the Company  acquired  Frank J. Fabozzi  Publishing  and  Australian
publisher,  Wrightbooks  Pty Ltd., both publishers of high quality finance books
for the professional market.


Scientific, Technical, and Medical (STM):

The Company is a leading  publisher for the scientific,  technical,  and medical
communities worldwide including, scientists, researchers, clinicians, engineers,
students and  professors,  and academic and corporate  librarians.  STM products
include journals, major reference works, reference books and protocols, in print
and online. STM publishing areas include the life and physical sciences,  select
medical areas, chemistry, statistics and mathematics, electrical and electronics
engineering,   and   telecommunications.   STM  develops   products  for  global
distribution   through   multiple   channels,   including   library   consortia,
subscription  agents,  bookstores,  online  booksellers,  and  direct  sales  to
professional society members and other customers.  Global STM represented 38% of
total  Company  revenue in fiscal year 2006.  STM's  revenue  grew at a compound
annual rate of 9% over the past five years.

Established  commercially  in  1999,  the  Company's  web-based  service,  Wiley
InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com), offers online access to more than 400
journals  and 2,000 major  reference  works,  online  books,  Current  Protocols
laboratory  manuals  and  databases,  as  well as a suite  of  professional  and
management resources. Wiley InterScience is based on a successful business model
that features Enhanced Access Licenses. One to three years in duration, Enhanced
Access Licenses provide academic and corporate  customers with multi-site online
access.  The Company also offers other flexible  pricing  options such as, Basic
Access licenses,  which provide click-on access  title-by-title to the Company's
electronic journal content. Access is also provided through Pay-Per-View,  which
serves customers who wish to purchase individual articles or chapters. With over
24 million users in 90 countries around the globe,  Wiley InterScience is one of
the world's leading providers of scientific, technical, and medical content.

Wiley InterScience  takes advantage of technology to update content  frequently,
and it adds new  features  and  resources  on an ongoing  basis to increase  the
productivity  of  scientists,  professionals  and  students.  Two  examples  are
EarlyView,  through  which  customers  can access  individual  articles  well in
advance of print publication,  and  MobileEditions,  which enables users to view
tables of content and  abstracts on wireless  handheld  devices and  Web-enabled
phones.

In 2005,  the Company  announced an ambitious new program to digitize its entire
historical journal content,  dating back to the 1800s.  Wiley's  digitization of
legacy  content is designed to improve the research  pathway and ensure  content
discovery is as seamless and efficient as possible.  The initiative is scheduled
for  completion  in 2007.  The backfile  collection,  which is available  online
through Wiley  InterScience,  will span two centuries of scientific research and
comprise over 7.5 million pages - one of the largest archives of its kind issued
by a single publisher.  As of April 30, 2006  approximately 70% of the Company's
journal content was digitized and made available to customers.

<PAGE>

Publishing  alliances play a major role in STM's success.  The Company publishes
the journals of prestigious  societies,  including the American Cancer Society's
flagship  publication,  Cancer.  These alliances bring mutual benefit,  with the
societies  gaining  Wiley's  publishing  and  marketing  expertise,  while Wiley
receives   peer-reviewed   content  and  enhanced   visibility   among   society
memberships.

Key  Acquisitions:  In fiscal year 2006, the Company acquired  InfoPoems Inc., a
leading provider of  evidence-based  medicine (EBM). This acquisition along with
the Cochrane  Collaboration  database  provides the foundation for the Company's
fast growing suite of EBM products designed to improve patient healthcare at the
point of care.  Evidenced-based medicine facilitates the effective management of
patients through clinical  expertise  informed by best practice evidence that is
derived from medical literature.

In fiscal year 2002,  the Company  acquired  A&M  Publishing  Ltd., a U.K.-based
publisher for the pharmaceutical and health-care sectors, and GIT Verlag GmbH, a
German publisher for the chemical, pharmaceutical,  biotechnology, security, and
engineering  industries.   These  businesses  derive  revenue  principally  from
advertising.   From  this  base,   the  Company  is  building   its  program  of
advertising-based  journal  publications,  including the acquisition of Dialysis
and Transplantation in fiscal year 2006.


Higher Education:

The Company publishes  educational  materials for the higher education market in
all  media,  focusing  on  courses  in  the  sciences,  geography,  mathematics,
engineering,  accounting,  business,  economics,  computer science,  psychology,
education,  and modern  languages.  In Australia,  the Company is also a leading
publisher for the secondary school market.

Higher  Education  customers  include  undergraduate,   graduate,  and  advanced
placement  students,  educators,  and lifelong  learners  worldwide.  Product is
delivered  principally through college bookstores,  online booksellers,  and Web
sites.  Globally,  Higher Educational  publishing generated 19% of total Company
revenue in fiscal year 2006. Through organic growth and acquired products,  both
print and  electronic,  the  Company's  worldwide  Higher  Education  publishing
revenue grew at a compound annual rate of 5% over the past five years.

Higher  Education's  mission is to help teachers teach and students  learn.  Our
strategy  is to provide  value-added  quality  materials  and  services  through
textbooks,  supplemental  study aids,  course and homework  management tools and
more,  in print and  electronic  formats.  The Higher  Education web site offers
online learning  materials with links to more than 4,000 companion  sub-sites to
support and supplement textbooks.

Higher Education delivers high-quality online learning materials that offer more
opportunities  for customization  and accommodate  diverse learning styles.  The
prime  example is  WileyPlus,  an  activity-based  interface  that  provides  an
integrated suite of teaching and learning resources on one web site. By offering
an  electronic  version of a text along with  supplementary  materials,  content
provided by the instructor,  and  administrative  tools,  WileyPlus supports the
full range of course-oriented activities online-planning,  presentations, study,
homework, and testing.

The Company  also  supports  online  communities  of interest  such as the Wiley
Faculty Network, a peer-to-peer network of faculty/professors supporting the use
of  online  course  material  tools  and  discipline-specific  software  in  the
classroom.  The Company believes this unique,  reliable,  and accessible service
gives the Company a competitive advantage.

Higher Education is also leveraging the web in its sales and marketing  efforts.
The web enhances the Company's  ability to have direct contact with students and
faculty at  universities  worldwide  through the use of  interactive  electronic
brochures and e-mail campaigns.

Key Acquisitions:  In fiscal year 2003, the Company acquired the assets of Maris
Technologies to support the Company's efforts to produce  web-enabled  products.
This acquisition included the market-leading software Edugen, which provides the
underlying technology for WileyPlus. Located in Moscow, the development facility
is staffed by  approximately  52 programmers and designers who had been employed
in the space program of the former Soviet Union. In fiscal year 2002 the Company
acquired publishing assets consisting of 47 higher education titles from Thomson
Learning.  The  titles  are in such  areas as  business,  earth  and  biological
sciences, foreign languages, mathematics, nutrition, and psychology.



Publishing Operations
- ---------------------

Journal Products:

The Company publishes over 2,400 journals and other  subscription-based  STM and
Professional/Trade  products,  which  accounted  for  approximately  33%  of the
Company's fiscal year 2006 revenue.  Most journals are owned by the Company,  in
which case they may or may not be sponsored by a professional  society. Some are
owned by societies and published by the Company pursuant to contracts. Societies
that  sponsor or own such  journals  generally  receive a royalty  and/or  other
consideration.   The  Company   usually  enters  into  agreements  with  outside
independent  editors of journals  that state the duties of the editors,  and the
fees and expenses for their services.  Contributors of journal articles transfer
publication rights to the Company or a professional society, as applicable.

Journal  subscriptions  result  primarily  from licenses for Wiley  InterScience
negotiated  directly with customers or their subscription agent by the Company's
sales representatives,  direct mail or other advertising, promotional campaigns,
and memberships in professional  societies for those journals that are sponsored
by such societies. Licenses range from one to three years in duration.

Printed journals are generally  mailed to subscribers  directly from independent
printers. Journal content is available online. Subscription revenue is generally
collected in advance,  and is deferred and recognized as earned when the related
issue is shipped or made available  online, or over the term of the subscription
as services are rendered.

Book Products:

Materials for book publications are obtained from authors throughout most of the
world through the efforts of an editorial staff, outside editorial advisors, and
advisory boards.  Most materials originate with their authors, or as a result of
suggestion or  solicitations  by editors and advisors.  The Company  enters into
agreements  with  authors  that state the terms and  conditions  under which the
materials will be published, the name in which the copyright will be registered,
the  basis  for any  royalties,  and  other  matters.  Most of the  authors  are
compensated  by  royalties,  which vary with the nature of the  product  and its
anticipated  sales  potential.  The Company may make  advance  payments  against
future royalties to authors of certain publications.

The Company continues to add new titles, revise existing titles, and discontinue
the  sale  of  others  in the  normal  course  of its  business,  also  creating
adaptations of original content for specific markets fulfilling customer demand.
The Company's  general  practice is to revise its textbooks  every three to five
years,   if   warranted,   and  to   revise   other   titles   as   appropriate.
Subscription-based  products are updated more frequently on a regular  schedule.
Approximately 34% of the Company's fiscal year 2006 U.S. book-publishing revenue
was from titles published or revised in the current fiscal year.

Professional  and consumer books are sold to bookstores  and online  booksellers
serving the general public;  wholesalers who supply such  bookstores;  warehouse
clubs;  college  bookstores  for  their  non-textbook  requirements;  individual
practitioners;   and  research   institutions,   libraries   (including  public,
professional,  academic, and other special libraries), industrial organizations,
and government agencies.

<PAGE>

The Company employs sales representatives who call upon independent  bookstores,
national  and  regional  chain  bookstores  and  wholesalers.   Trade  sales  to
bookstores and wholesalers are generally made on a returnable basis with certain
restrictions.  The Company  provides for estimated  future returns on sales made
during  the  year  principally   based  on  historical   experience.   Sales  of
professional  and  consumer  books  also  result  from  direct  mail  campaigns,
telemarketing, online access, and advertising and reviews in periodicals.

Adopted textbooks and related supplementary material (i.e., textbooks prescribed
for course use) are sold primarily to bookstores  including  online  bookstores,
serving educational institutions.  The Company employs sales representatives who
call on faculty  responsible for selecting  books to be used in courses,  and on
the bookstores that serve such  institutions and their students.  Textbook sales
are generally made on a fully  returnable basis with certain  restrictions.  The
textbook  business is seasonal,  with the majority of textbook  sales  occurring
during the June through August and November through January periods. There is an
active used textbook market, which adversely affects the sales of new textbooks.

Like most other  publishers,  the Company  generally  contracts with independent
printers and binderies for their services.  The Company purchases its paper from
independent  suppliers and printers.  The fiscal year 2006 weighted average U.S.
paper  prices  increased  approximately  6% over  fiscal  year 2005.  Management
believes that adequate printing and binding facilities, and sources of paper and
other required materials, are available to it, and that it is not dependent upon
any  single   supplier.   Printed  book  products  are  distributed   from  both
Company-operated warehouses and independent distributors.

The Company  develops content in digital format that can be used for both online
and print products,  which results in productivity  and efficiency  savings,  as
well as enabling the Company to offer customized  publishing and print-on-demand
products. Book content is increasingly being made available online through Wiley
InterScience,  WileyPlus  and  other  platforms,  and in  eBook  format  through
licenses with alliance partners. The Company also sponsors online communities of
interest,  both on its own and in partnership with others,  to expand the market
for its products.

The Company believes that the demand for new electronic technology products will
continue to increase.  Accordingly,  to properly  service its  customers  and to
remain competitive, the Company anticipates it will be necessary to increase its
expenditures related to such new technologies over the next several years.

The internet not only enables the Company to deliver  content  online,  but also
helps to sell more books. The growth of online booksellers  benefits the Company
because they provide  unlimited  virtual "shelf space" for the Company's  entire
backlist.

Marketing and distribution services are made available to other publishers under
agency  arrangements.  The Company also engages in  co-publishing of titles with
international  publishers  and in publication of adaptations of works from other
publishers for particular  markets.  The Company also receives licensing revenue
from photocopies,  reproductions,  and electronic uses of its content as well as
advertising revenue from web sites such as Frommers.com.


Global Operations
- -----------------

The  Company's  publications  are  sold  throughout  most of the  world  through
operations located in Europe,  Canada,  Australia,  Asia, and the United States.
All operations  market their  indigenous  publications,  as well as publications
produced by other parts of the Company.  The Company  also markets  publications
through agents as well as sales  representatives  in countries not served by the
Company.  John  Wiley  & Sons  International  Rights,  Inc.  sells  reprint  and
translations  rights  worldwide.  The Company  publishes  or licenses  others to
publish  its  products,  which  are  distributed  throughout  the  world in many
languages.  Approximately  41% of the  Company's  fiscal  year 2006  revenue was
derived from  non-U.S.  markets.

<PAGE>

Competition and Economic Drivers Within the Publishing Industry
- ---------------------------------------------------------------

The  sectors of the  publishing  industry  in which the  Company is engaged  are
highly  competitive.  The  principal  competitive  criteria  for the  publishing
industry are considered to be the following:  product quality, customer service,
suitability  of format and subject  matter,  author  reputation,  price,  timely
availability  of both  new  titles  and  revisions  of  existing  books,  online
availability  of  published  information,  and timely  delivery  of  products to
customers.

The  Company  is in the top  rank of  publishers  of  scientific  and  technical
journals worldwide,  as well as a leading commercial  chemistry publisher at the
research  level;  one  of the  leading  publishers  of  university  and  college
textbooks and related materials for the "hardside" disciplines,  (i.e. sciences,
engineering,  and  mathematics),   and  a  leading  publisher  in  its  targeted
professional/trade markets. The Company knows of no reliable industry statistics
that would enable it to determine its share of the various international markets
in which it operates.


Performance Measurements
- ------------------------

The Company  measures its  performance  based upon  revenue,  operating  income,
earnings per share and cash flow growth,  excluding  unusual or one-time events,
and considering current worldwide and regional economic  conditions.  Because of
the  Company's  unique blend of  businesses,  industry  statistics do not always
provide  meaningful   comparisons.   The  Company  does  maintain  market  share
statistics for publishing programs in  Professional/Trade  and Higher Education.
For  Professional/Trade,  market  share  statistics  published  by  BOOKSCAN,  a
statistical  clearinghouse for book industry point of sale in the United States,
are used. The statistics include survey data from all major retail outlets, mass
merchandisers, small chain and independent retail outlets. For Higher Education,
the Company subscribes to Management  Practices Inc., which publishes customized
comparative sales reports.


Results of Operations
- ---------------------

Fiscal Year 2006 Summary Results

For the full year,  revenue  advanced 7% over prior year to $1.0 billion,  or 8%
excluding foreign currency effects. The year-on-year growth was driven by all of
Wiley's  businesses  around the world.  Gross profit margin for fiscal year 2006
was 67.2%  compared with 66.6% in the prior year.  Improvements  in STM,  Higher
Education and the European  segment were partially offset by lower gross margins
in Professional/Trade and other segments.

Operating and administrative  expenses increased 8% over the prior year. Foreign
exchange  accounted for approximately  $1.9 million of the increase.  Editorial,
sales,   marketing  and  distribution  costs  to  support  revenue  growth,  and
investments in technology were partially  offset by lower costs  associated with
certification of internal controls as required by Sarbanes-Oxley  404. Operating
and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 51% in both years.

Operating  income  advanced  8% to  $152.7  million  in  fiscal  year 2006 or 9%
excluding  adverse foreign currency  effects.  Revenue growth and improved gross
margins  were  partially  offset by  higher  amortization  due to  acquisitions.
Operating  margin  was 14.6%  compared  with  14.5% in  fiscal  year  2005.  The
operating  margin increase  reflects  improvement in gross margin due to product
mix,  partially  offset by higher  amortization  of  intangibles.  Net  interest
expense and other  increased $3.1 million to $8.8 million,  mainly due to higher
interest rates.

The Company's  effective  tax rate was 23.3% in fiscal year 2006.  Excluding the
tax charges and benefits  described in the non-GAAP  financial  disclosure,  the
effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006  increased to 33.2% as compared to 32.7%
in fiscal year 2005. The increase was mainly due to higher effective foreign tax
rates.

Earnings  per  diluted  share and net income  for fiscal  year 2006 on a US GAAP
basis  were  $1.85  and  $110.3   million,   respectively.   Excluding  the  tax
adjustments,  which are further described below,  earnings per diluted share and
net income for fiscal year 2006 on a Non-GAAP  basis rose 10% to $1.61 and 5% to
$96.1  million,  respectively.  Growth in earnings  per diluted  share  reflects
favorable operating performance and the Company's share repurchase program.

<PAGE>

Non-GAAP Financial  Measures:  The Company's  management  evaluates  performance
excluding unusual and/or  nonrecurring  events.  The Company believes  excluding
such events  provides a more  effective and comparable  measure of  performance.
Since  adjusted  net income and  adjusted  earnings  per share are not a measure
calculated in accordance  with GAAP, it should not be considered as a substitute
for other  GAAP  measures,  including  net  income and  earnings  per share,  as
reported, as an indicator of operating performance.

Adjusted net income and adjusted  earnings per diluted  share  excluding the tax
charges and benefits are as follows:

=================================================================================
</TABLE>

Pursuant to guidance  issued by the Internal  Revenue  Service in May 2005,  the
Company  recorded a tax  benefit of  approximately  $7.5  million,  or $0.12 per
diluted  share,  in the first  quarter of fiscal year 2006,  and reduced  income
taxes due on the fiscal year 2005  repatriation  of earnings  from its  European
subsidiaries.  As previously  discussed in the Company's  Annual Report filed on
Form 10-K for fiscal  year 2005,  the tax  benefit  offsets a tax charge of $7.5
million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, neither of which had
a cash impact to the Company.

A $6.8 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, tax benefit related to the favorable
resolution of certain tax matters with tax authorities was also reported for the
full year ending April 30, 2006.  The Company's  management  excludes  these tax
items for  comparative  purposes so as to not distort the  underlying  operating
performance of the Company.

Cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2006 of $242.6 million
was used to fund  investing  activities  ($113.6  million),  inclusive  of $31.4
million for the acquisition of publishing  assets; to acquire 2.8 million shares
of treasury stock ($108.9  million);  repay debt ($32.5  million);  and for cash
dividends to shareholders ($21.1 million).


Fiscal Year 2006 Segment Results

Contribution Margin           28.1%         29.2%
</TABLE>

Revenue growth of Wiley's U.S. P/T business  accelerated  throughout fiscal year
2006, culminating in a strong fourth quarter. Revenue for the full year advanced
9% to $380 million,  while fourth quarter revenue reached a record $106 million,
13% over the same period in the prior year.  Virtually  all of P/T's  publishing
categories and sales channels  contributed to the strong results,  with standout
performances by the technology, business, finance and architectural programs, as
well as global  rights and website  advertising.  P/T's  finance and  leadership
programs,  as well as the Sybex  technology  titles it acquired in May 2005, and
the  popularity  of  the  Sudoku  for  Dummies  series  helped  to  deliver  the
record-setting  results.  The Sybex  acquisition  contributed  approximately  $9
million to revenue.
<PAGE>

Direct  contribution  to  profit  was up 5% for the  year.  The  improvement  in
top-line  results was  partially  offset by higher  cost of sales  mainly due to
product mix.

A number of successful  titles  contributed to the year's  results,  notably The
Little  Book That  Beats the  Market by Joel  Greenblatt;  Sudoku  For  Dummies,
Volumes 1-3 by Andrew  Herron and Edmund  James;  Weight  Watcher's New Complete
Cookbook; Betty Crocker Cookbook: Everything You Need to Know to Cook Today; and
Hedgehogging by Barton Biggs.  Several  perennial  favorites and new titles also
made significant contributions, including Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick
Lencioni;  his new title, Silos,  Politics,  and Turf Wars;  Automatic Wealth by
Michael  Masterson;  and The Party of the Century:  The Fabulous Story of Truman
Capote and His Black and White Ball by Deborah  Davis.  A new series,  Frommer's
Day by Day, and the first Frommers.com  Podcast,  successfully extended this key
brand.

Media attention was  particularly  focused on a number of titles tied to current
affairs (Bird Flu by Marc Siegel and The Global Class War by Jeff Faux); popular
products  (The Bear  Necessities  of Business:  Building a Company with Heart by
Maxine  Clark and Amy  Joyner at the  flagship  Build-a-Bear  store);  or movies
(Party of the Century by Deborah Davis which  capitalized  on the success of the
movie,  Capote),  as well as well-known  authors (The Poker Face of Wall Street,
Aaron Brown and Hedgehogging by Barton Biggs).  Aggressive  marketing kept Wiley
brands and titles in the public eye, including a major advertising  campaign for
Little  Book That  Beats the Market in The Wall  Street  Journal  and  Bloomberg
radio; the annual For Dummies month promotions;  and a pay-per-view webcast with
Amazon.com, featuring author Pat Lencioni.

More than 800 articles were adapted from the For Dummies text for licensing with
Yahoo Tech, a new website that provides consumers with advice and information on
technology. An agreement with Microsoft was signed to license content from seven
of Wiley's top  cookbooks,  including  How to Cook  Everything  by Mark Bittman,
Cooking at Home with The Culinary Institute of America, and Mr. Boston: Official
Bartender's and Party Guide by Mr. Boston, Anthony Giglio, and Steven McDonald).

Mark Bittman  received a James Beard  Foundation  Media  Broadcast  Award in the
category  National  Television Food Show for his work as host of the PBS series,
How to Cook Everything,  which is tied in with the Wiley title of the same name.
The Handbook of Human Resources  Management in Government by Stephen Condrey won
"Best  Public  Sector  Human  Resources  Management  Book" award of the American
Society  for Public  Administration.  Lee  Shulman,  President  of the  Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, won the prestigious Grawemeyer Award
in Education for 2006, for The Wisdom of Practice.

Contribution Margin          46.6%          46.7%
</TABLE>

Wiley's U.S. STM business  delivered  consistently  excellent results throughout
fiscal year 2006, growing revenue over prior year by 8% to $206 million.  Direct
contribution to profit also rose by 8% for the year.

Subscription and non-subscription  revenue from journal backfiles,  advertising,
and commercial reprints contributed  significantly to growth. The reference book
program completed its second year of strong growth driven by strong title output
and global market  strength.  STM also  benefited  from recent  acquisitions  of
Dialysis and  Transplantation,  a medical  journal and InfoPOEMs,  a provider of
evidence-based medicine content.

Wiley  InterScience,  the Company's  online service,  reached a milestone midway
through  the  fiscal  year:  more  than one  million  journal  articles  are now
available  online.  The value of this growing body of  literature  to the global
research community can be quantified in the concurrent increase in the number of
users, as well as the number of manuscripts submitted for publication.

<PAGE>

In fiscal year 2006, U.S. STM received approximately 9% more journal manuscripts
and published 8% more journal pages than the previous  year.  More people gained
access  to Wiley  InterScience  by  taking  advantage  of  alternate  purchasing
programs,  such as Pay-Per-View,  which began offering  individual article sales
from the growing backfile  collection during this year. At the end of the fiscal
year, Wiley  participated  with Microsoft in the launch of Windows Live Academic
Search pilot,  which improves the search  capabilities  of journal  content from
Wiley and ten other major STM publishers.

Important  publications  during  the  year  include  the  inaugural  issue  of a
pharmaceutical-company  sponsored Chinese-language digest version of Hepatology;
the Physics and Astronomy Backfile,  which includes the oldest journal published
by Wiley,  Annalen  der  Physik,  founded  in 1799;  the first two issues of the
Journal of  Hospital  Medicine;  and a  refurbished  Annals of  Neurology.  Also
released  during  the  fourth  quarter  were the new 18th  edition  of the Merck
Manual;  the 8th edition of The Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data; and a wide
array of single and multi-volume reference works.

During the fourth  quarter,  the Company reached an agreement with the Institute
of   Electrical   and   Electronics   Engineers   of  Japan  to  publish  a  new
English-language  journal, IEEJ Transactions;  extended its long-term publishing
agreement for the Journal of Research in Science Teaching; and began publication
of the  Journal  of  Orthopedic  Research  in  partnership  with the  Orthopedic
Research Society.

Contribution Margin           25.6%          25.3%
</TABLE>

Wiley's U.S. Higher  Education  business  increased 4% to $156 million in fiscal
year 2006. Continuing to build on the strength experienced in the third quarter,
fourth  quarter  revenue  advanced  15% to $23 million  compared to the previous
year's  quarter.  Higher  Education's  direct  contribution  margin for the year
improved  30 basis  points to 25.6%  mainly due to lower  composition  costs and
inventory provisions.

The  mathematics,  life  sciences,  engineering  and computer  science  programs
performed   extremely   well   during  the  year,   with   strong   showings  by
Tortora/Principles    of    Anatomy    and    Physiology;    Black/Microbiology;
Voet/Fundamentals  of  Biochemistry;   Hughes-Hallet/Calculus;   Anton/Calculus;
Munson/Fluid Mechanics; and Horstman/Big Java.

WileyPLUS  continued to gain traction  during fiscal year 2006, as more students
and faculty around the world chose to use its customizable multi-format suite of
content,  teaching and learning tools to help them do homework, study for tests,
assess coursework, and administer classes.

Wiley has  developed  a wider  array of products  at varied  price  points.  The
Company is now offering over 50 titles in Wiley Desktop  Editions,  which are in
downloadable e-text format, intended for students who want lower-priced versions
of  textbooks.  Wiley  began to produce  Desktop  Editions in  partnership  with
VitalSource Technologies, Inc., during the second quarter, and expects to nearly
double the number of titles in the program by calendar year-end.

Soon after the end of the fiscal year, Wiley became  Microsoft's sole publishing
partner  worldwide for all Microsoft  Official Academic Course (MOAC) materials.
Microsoft and Wiley will collaborate on a new co-branded  series of textbook and
e-learning  products  for the higher  education  market,  to be  released  under
Wiley-Microsoft  logos.  Wiley will also assume  responsibility  for the sale of
existing MOAC titles.  The new series will offer topics covering  Windows Vista,
Microsoft Office Systems 2007, and the Windows Server codenamed  "Longhorn." All
titles  will be marketed  globally  and  available  in several  languages.  With
Microsoft's  position as the world's leading software company and Wiley's global
presence in higher education, the alliance is an ideal strategic fit.

<PAGE>

Earlier in the year,  Higher  Education  extended its global  alliance  with the
National  Geographic  Society to create new products sold exclusively with Wiley
textbooks and WileyPLUS.

Fiscal Year 2006 was another strong year for Wiley's  European-based  companies,
with revenues for the year advancing 9% over the prior year to $292 million,  or
12%  excluding  foreign  currency  effects.  Virtually  all  of  Wiley  Europe's
businesses,  product lines, and markets  contributed to the performance.  Strong
performance was exhibited in P/T and STM book  publishing,  as well as journals.
Global sales from the Sudoku For Dummies  series  contributed to the increase in
P/T revenue.  Direct  contribution margin was essentially in line with the prior
year's results.

Best-selling  books  included  products  as  diverse  as the  second  edition of
Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry, edited by R. Bruce King, and the enormously
popular Sudoku For Dummies and Kakuro For Dummies.  The power of the For Dummies
brand was  evidenced by the  publication  of a six-figure  print run of a custom
mini-book  for the World Cup,  Winning on Betfair  For  Dummies.  The German For
Dummies program published 51 new titles and 49 reprints during fiscal year 2006.

The expansion of Wiley Europe's  publishing  portfolio has opened up new markets
and customer  groups.  The technology  channel saw strong growth  throughout the
year with a series of agreements with major telecommunications  corporations. In
February,  the  Company  entered a popular new market  with the  acquisition  of
Fernhurst Books, a best-selling list of manuals and guides on sailing,  boating,
and  other  nautical  sports.  The first  seven  titles  of the  Securities  and
Investment Institute series published during fiscal year 2006.

Wiley Europe's new journals,  small, an interdisciplinary journal on nanoscience
and  nanotechnology   embracing  materials  science,   physics,   chemistry  and
biosciences and the related engineering areas ChemMedChem; and the Biotechnology
Journal,  all performed well.  Chemistry-An  Asian Journal,  an alliance between
Wiley-VCH,  the German  Chemical  Society,  and  several  major  Asian  chemical
societies, gained traction during the year as new societies signed on, including
The Singapore  National  Institute of Chemistry and the Chemical Society located
in Taipei.

The Cochrane  Collaboration,  an evidence-based  medicine collection,  available
through  Wiley  InterScience,  finished  the year  strongly  reflecting  Wiley's
ability to increase  revenue through the Company's  multiple sales channels.  To
extend Wiley's product  offering in  evidence-based  medicine,  Wiley Europe and
Duodecim Medical Publications Limited of Helsinki, Finland announced an expanded
agreement  to grant Wiley the  exclusive  publishing,  sales,  and  distribution
rights of its English language  version of  Evidence-Based  Medicine  Guidelines
(EBM Guidelines).  The guidelines are designed to be read on small screens,  and
are available via the Internet and through  Personal  Digital  Assistants  (PDA)
devices.

</TABLE>

Wiley's  revenue in Asia,  Australia,  and Canada advanced 14% over the previous
year  to  $124  million,  or 12%  excluding  foreign  currency  effects.  Higher
Education and secondary school publishing in Australia and P/T sales in Asia and
Canada drove the improvement over the prior year. Direct  contribution to profit
for the year increased 8%, or 3% excluding  foreign  currency  effects.

<PAGE>

Revenue  growth was  partially  offset by product mix in Canada and Asia.  Wiley
Asia experienced  growth across all product lines,  particularly in India, Japan
and  China.  Wiley  Canada's  P/T  performance  was very  strong  and its Higher
Education program was solid. In Australia, all three businesses delivered strong
results.

At the end of the third quarter,  Wiley Asia acquired the remaining  outstanding
shares of Wiley  Dreamtech  (India) Private LTD. The acquisition is an important
step in the  Company's  plans to grow Wiley's  presence in India,  extending its
sales and  marketing  reach and building  local  publishing  capabilities  in an
important and rapidly  growing  market.  Wiley  acquired a majority  interest in
Dreamtech in 2001 as part of its highly successful  acquisition of Hungry Minds,
Inc.

Wiley  Australia  was once again named  Secondary  Publisher  of the Year by the
Australian Publishers  Association and Higher Education Publisher of the Year by
the  Australian  Campus  Booksellers  Association,  for the  9th and 8th  times,
respectively,  during the last decade. Wiley Australia was also awarded, for the
fifth year in a row, the 'Employer of Choice for Women'  citation by the Federal
Government's  Equal  Opportunity  in the  Workplace  Agency.  Wiley  is the only
publisher  that has earned  this honor  during the  program's  entire  five-year
history.

Considerable  success  was  achieved  in  Canada  with  the  sale of  WileyPLUS,
demonstrating  the product's global appeal.  The number of titles available with
WileyPLUS  more than  doubled  from  fiscal  year 2005,  giving the sales  force
opportunity  to sell it into more course areas.  During fiscal year 2006,  Wiley
Canada added to its  indigenous  P/T program by becoming a key  publisher in the
regional  real  estate  markets.  Sales  throughout  the  year  in  real  estate
investing,  home inspection,  property management,  tax, and other subcategories
were very strong, as the Company added a number of titles to its portfolio.



Fiscal Year 2005 Summary Results

In fiscal year 2005 revenue advanced 6% over the prior year to $974 million,  or
4%  excluding  foreign  currency  effects.  The  year-on-year  growth was driven
primarily by the Company's global Scientific, Technical and Medical business and
the Professional/Trade  business,  particularly in Europe and Asia. Gross profit
margin for fiscal  year 2005 was 66.6%  compared  with 66.5% in the prior  year.
Improvements in U.S.  Professional/Trade and the European segment were partially
offset by lower gross margins in other segments.

Operating and administrative  expenses,  excluding the adverse impact of foreign
exchange on costs  (approximately  $6.5  million),  increased  3% over the prior
year.  Sales and marketing costs to support revenue growth,  annual  performance
compensation costs,  auditing and compliance costs associated with certification
of  internal  controls  as required by  Sarbanes-Oxley  404 ($3.2  million)  and
investments  in technology to deliver  products to our customers  were partially
offset by relocation incentive receipts from the State of New Jersey.  Operating
and administrative  expenses as a percent of revenue improved 50 basis points to
51%, reflecting prudent expense management.

Operating  income  advanced  9% to $141.4  million in fiscal  year  2005,  or 7%
excluding foreign currency gains.  Primarily revenue growth, lower inventory and
royalty provisions and prudent expense management drove the year-on-year growth.
Operating  margin  was 14.5%  compared  with  14.0% in  fiscal  year  2004.  The
operating  margin  increase  reflects  improvement  in gross  margin  and  lower
operating and administrative  expenses as a percentage of revenue.  Net interest
expense and other increased $1.4 million to $5.7 million.  Higher interest rates
were partially offset by lower debt.

The Company's  effective  tax rate was 38.2% in fiscal year 2005.  Excluding the
tax charges and benefits  described in the non-GAAP  financial  disclosure,  the
effective tax rate for fiscal year 2005  increased to 32.7% as compared to 31.4%
in fiscal year 2004, mainly due to higher effective foreign tax rates.

Earnings  per  diluted  share and net income for fiscal year 2005 were $1.35 and
$83.8  million.  Excluding  the tax accrual on the  dividends  repatriated  from
European subsidiaries in fiscal year 2005 and the tax benefit reported in fiscal
year 2004, which are described below,  earnings per diluted share and net income
for the  fiscal  year  ended  April  30,  2005  rose 8% to $1.47 and 6% to $91.3
million, respectively.

<PAGE>

Non-GAAP  Financial  Measures:  The  Company's  management  evaluates  operating
performance  excluding unusual and/or nonrecurring  events. The Company believes
excluding  such  events  provides a more  effective  and  comparable  measure of
performance. Since adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are not a
measure  calculated  in  accordance  with GAAP, it should not be considered as a
substitute for other GAAP measures, including net income and earnings per share,
as reported, as an indicator of operating performance.

Adjusted net income and adjusted  earnings per diluted  share  excluding the tax
charges and benefits are as follows:

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company elected to repatriate
approximately $94 million of dividends from its European  subsidiaries under the
American  Jobs Creation Act of 2004,  which became law in October 2004.  The law
provided a favorable  one-time tax rate on dividends from foreign  subsidiaries.
The tax accrual on the dividend included  approximately  $7.5 million,  or $0.12
per diluted  share of tax,  which had no cash impact on the Company.  The income
statement  effect  recorded in the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2005 was fully
offset by a tax benefit recognized by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal
year 2006.

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2004, the Company reported a net tax benefit
of $3.0 million,  or $0.05 per diluted share,  due to a favorable  resolution of
certain  state and  federal tax matters  and an  adjustment  of accrued  foreign
taxes.

Cash flow provided by operating  activities in fiscal year 2005 increased 15% to
$243.5 million from $212.2 million in the prior year. Cash provided by operating
activities,  net of  cash  used  for  investments  in  product  development  and
property,  equipment and  technology of $91.2 million,  was utilized  during the
year to acquire  2.9 million  shares of Class A common  stock  ($94.8  million);
acquire  publishing  assets  (aggregating  $22.5 million);  purchase  marketable
securities  of  ($10.0  million);  and  pay  dividends  to  shareholders  ($18.1
million).

Contribution Margin           29.2%          27.6%
</TABLE>

Revenue of Wiley's U.S. P/T  business  increased 3% to $350.3  million in fiscal
year  2005,  as a  result  of  organic  growth  in  key  publishing  categories,
particularly For Dummies books, the professional  culinary program and Webster's
New World  Dictionary.  High-end  technology  titles showed  improvement for the
year, while consumer technology  publishing remained sluggish.  Other publishing
revenue,  principally generated through brand licensing,  the sale of rights and
online  advertising and improved sales return experience also contributed to the
favorable results.

<PAGE>

P/T's direct contribution to profit was up 9% over fiscal year 2004,  reflecting
gross  margin  improvement  due to lower  inventory,  sales  returns  and author
advance  provisions,   and  prudent  expense  management.   Contribution  margin
increased by 160 basis points to 29.2%  reflecting  lower provisions and product
mix.

Titles included on bestseller  lists for the year were the  market-leading  J.K.
Lasser's Your Income Tax, as well as  Lencioni/Five  Dysfunctions  of a Team and
Tyson/Investing  For  Dummies;  Winger/Shut  Up,  Stop  Whining  and Get a Life;
Scott/Mentored  by a  Millionaire;  Harkins/Everybody  Wins;  Lencioni/Death  by
Meeting;  Allen/Multiple  Streams of Income;  Mauldin/Bull's Eye Investing;  and
Tisch/The Power of We. The second editions of three  bestselling  Windows XP For
Dummies titles were published during the year, tied to Microsoft's launch of the
Windows XP Service Pack 2.

P/T took advantage of the considerable potential of its industry-leading  brands
throughout fiscal year 2005. Frommers.com,  Dummies.com, and CliffsNotes.com all
had a strong year,  in terms of site  traffic,  subscriber  counts and sales.  A
redesigned  CliffsNotes.com  launched in August,  forming the  cornerstone  of a
major brand awareness  initiative and  significantly  increasing  traffic to the
website.  In January, a redesigned  Frommers.com site was launched that includes
several new features,  improved  search  functionality  and standard ad sizes to
accommodate  advertiser  demand.  These  improvements  were  well  received,  as
evidenced by record highs in monthly traffic and book sales.

An  agreement  with MTV was signed  during  the year to publish an eight  volume
series  of  travel  guides  targeted  to  students  and  co-branded  as MTV  and
Frommer's.  A new site supporting  direct ordering by government  employees went
live in March,  providing  product  information and facilitating the purchase of
Wiley titles.

P/T's custom  publishing  had a banner year in fiscal year 2005.  These products
are typically used by organizations for promotional or incentive programs. Books
are  specifically  written for a customer or an existing P/T  publication can be
customized,  such as having the cover art include  custom  imprint,  messages or
slogans. Of special note are customized For Dummies  publications,  which are in
great demand by  corporations  and  organizations  around the world that want to
leverage the power of this well known brand.

During  the  year,  Wiley  signed  an  agreement  with  TTE   Corporation,   the
manufacturer of RCA digital  television  products,  to publish HDTV For Dummies;
launch a "Digital  TV Center"  site  featuring  technical  articles  and related
information;  and create a  customized  reference  and setup  guide that will be
packaged with select RCA products.

Contribution Margin         46.7%          48.5%
</TABLE>

Wiley's  U.S. STM revenue  increased  7% to $190.5  million in fiscal year 2005.
Electronic journals, new society publications and non-subscription revenue, such
as STM reference books, journal backfiles and advertising sales, all contributed
to the year-on-year growth.

STM's  direct  contribution  to profit for fiscal year 2005 was up 3% over prior
year, reflecting the combined effects of increased revenue and favorable product
mix,   partially  offset  by  costs   associated  with  new  society   journals.
Contribution margin for the year decreased 180 basis points to 46.7% principally
due to  increased  revenue  from  new  professional  society  journals  and  STM
reference  books.  While  society  journals  generate  margins  that  exceed the
Company's  consolidated  margins, they are less than the margins of wholly owned
journals.

Globally,  the STM business  recorded strong growth, up approximately 9% for the
full year. Journals and books, in print and online,  contributed to year-on-year
growth.  The global STM book program recorded its sixth  consecutive  quarter of
robust growth, especially in Europe and Asia, resulting in an increase of 12% in
fiscal  year  2005 over the  previous  year.  It was also a strong  year for the
electronic major reference work program.

<PAGE>

The  Company's  STM business  continued  its  transformation  to digital  access
through  Wiley   InterScience.   Electronic   journal   subscriptions  to  Wiley
InterScience are principally sold through Enhanced Access Licenses. One to three
years in duration,  these licenses provide academic and corporate customers with
multi-site  online access.  In fiscal year 2005, STM enjoyed healthy renewals of
Enhanced Access Licenses for Wiley InterScience.

More customers are also gaining access to Wiley InterScience  through Google and
taking  advantage of alternative  pricing  programs such as Pay-Per-View and the
new,   customer-driven  pricing  model  for  Wiley  InterScience  Online  Books.
Reference linking  improvements,  new marketing  initiatives like Google Adword,
ISI alerts and Wiley  InterScience  feature  boxes and the  addition of content,
including new society  journals and backfile  collections,  also  contributed to
access growth.  As a result,  usage during the fourth quarter increased 23% over
the third quarter and 56% over the previous year's fourth quarter.

Additional  digitized journal backfiles were added to Wiley InterScience through
the  launch  of  the  Cell  &  Developmental  Biology,  Analytical  Science  and
Neuroscience  collections.  The Company  announced  its ambitious new program to
digitize  its  entire  historical  journal  content,  dating  back to the 1800s.
Wiley's  digitization  of legacy  content is designed  to improve  the  research
pathway and ensure  content  discovery is as seamless and efficient as possible.
This initiative is scheduled for completion in 2007.

Wiley continued to develop its journal and book programs by forming partnerships
with prominent  national,  regional and international  societies.  In the fourth
quarter,  the Company  executed a multi-year  co-publishing  agreement  with the
American  Institute  of  Chemical  Engineers.  Earlier in the year,  the Company
signed  agreements  with the  Orthopaedic  Research  Society  and the Society of
Hospital Medicine. The American Society of Cytopathology adopted as its official
journal Cancer  Cytopathology,  which Wiley  publishes on behalf of the American
Cancer Society.

</TABLE>

Wiley's  U.S.  Higher  Education  business  closed out a  challenging  year with
revenue  of  $150.9  million,  down 1% from  the  previous  year.  The  decrease
reflected  industry-wide  price resistance among students and continued softness
in engineering,  mathematics and computer sciences,  and was partially offset by
improved sales returns.  Higher  Education's  direct  contribution  to profit in
fiscal  year 2005 was down 8% from the  previous  year and  contribution  margin
decreased  200  basis  points  to  25.3%,   reflecting  the  top-line   results,
investments  in new  products,  services  and  business  models,  and  inventory
write-offs.

During the fourth quarter, Higher Education began to roll out a strong frontlist
for the coming academic year, with a number of promising first editions, as well
as  revisions  of widely used  titles.  In  addition,  the number of  lower-cost
textbooks being offered  continues to increase.  Outside the States,  more local
adaptations of U.S. textbooks are being published, primarily for markets in Asia
and the Middle East.

During  fiscal  year  2005,  Higher  Education  signed a  multi-year  publishing
agreement  with  the  National  Geographic  Society  (NGS),  one of the  world's
foremost  research and educational  societies.  Wiley will create  textbooks and
digital  learning  tools  that will  incorporate  maps,  photographs,  graphics,
illustrations and videos from the NGS's vast library.  During the first quarter,
Wiley  renewed and  expanded  its  agreement  with Rand  McNally & Co. to be the
exclusive  distributor to the higher education  community of their Goode's World
Atlas. Other alliances formed during the year include agreements with GlobalSpec
to provide search  functionality  to  engineering  students  through  WileyPlus;
OuterNet   Publishing  to  co-develop  lab  manuals  for  introductory   biology
textbooks;  Tata,  a software  developer  in India,  for  licensing  and selling
business  simulations;  Just Ask!  to create  customized  online  solutions  for
several Wiley textbooks; and Aplia to sell  Besanko/Microeconomics 2e along with
their software product.

</TABLE>

Fiscal year 2005 was a strong year for Wiley's  European-based  companies,  with
revenue for the year advancing 13% over the prior year to $268.9 million,  or 8%
excluding foreign currency effects.  Journals and non-subscription revenue, such
as STM reference books and advertising  sales,  contributed to the  year-on-year
growth.   Indigenous  and  imported  P/T  titles  also  performed  well.  Direct
contribution to profit for the year was up 16% over prior year or 11%, excluding
foreign currency effects, reflecting top-line growth and favorable product mix.

Wiley's  success in Europe was  widespread  with nearly all business  categories
growing strongly. Noteworthy performances included the Cochrane Collaboration in
evidence-based  medicine,  the success of the U.K.  For Dummies  program and the
robust performance of the STM book program.

Wiley  continues to grow in Europe  through an effective  combination of organic
growth and  acquisitions.  During the fourth quarter,  the Company completed the
acquisition  of  London-based  publisher  of books and journals for the Nursing,
Speech and Language  Therapy and  Audiology,  Psychology  and Special  Education
markets.  The acquisition  brought to Wiley a distinguished list of professional
reference books, peer-reviewed journals and textbooks. Acquisitions completed in
fiscal year 2005 also included Microscopy and Analysis, a controlled circulation
journal;  the life science  reference  portfolio of the Nature Publishing Group;
the book list of Professional Engineering Publishing;  the publishing program of
the  Institute of  Mechanical  Engineers;  and four  journals from Henry Stewart
Publications.

Wiley signed an agreement during the fourth quarter with the British Library for
delivery of Wiley content through their document  delivery  service.  Earlier in
the year, the Company extended its publishing  partnerships  with the Society of
Chemical Industry and the Cochrane Collaboration database.  Closer collaboration
with the  American  Health  Care  Journalists  Society  and the  Centre  for the
Advancement of Health has generated media exposure for the database. Cooperative
marketing initiatives with a number of scholarly societies have also been formed
to promote other Wiley publications.

Wiley-VCH formed an alliance with the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, a
part of the Chinese  Academy of  Sciences,  to publish  the  Chinese  Journal of
Chemistry, the Institute's flagship journal. An agreement was also signed during
the  third  quarter  with the  Securities  Institute  to  publish  a  series  of
introductory  finance  books,  bringing  to Wiley a new  source of  authors  and
customers.

The power of the For Dummies brand in Europe was evident  throughout fiscal year
2005.  More  than one  million  copies of Wi-Fi For  Dummies,  which was  custom
published for Intel, were distributed to their customers throughout the U.K. All
visitors to the 2005  London  Book Fair  received a copy of the London Book Fair
Tips For Dummies, which was supported and distributed by Reed Exhibitions.  Over
160,000  copies  of  French  History  for  Dummies  have  been  sold  since  its
publication.

Wiley's  revenue in Asia,  Australia  and Canada was up a combined 10% to $108.6
million, or 6% excluding foreign currency effects. Revenue growth in all regions
contributed to the improvement,  particularly Asia, which grew 11% for the year.
Direct  contribution  to  profit  in fiscal  year  2005  increased  12% over the
previous  year,  or 2%  excluding  foreign  currency  effects.  The Canadian and
Australian  companies  purchase  certain  products from other Wiley locations in
U.S. dollars while primarily selling in local currency,  thereby contributing to
the more favorable results including foreign currency effects.

Asia showed impressive  revenue growth,  particularly  during the second half of
the year. STM books had an excellent  year,  driven by strong library markets in
India,  Taiwan,  Japan and Korea, and increased research funding in Malaysia and
Thailand.  P/T revenue was up despite the challenging retail environment in many
Asian markets.  Sales grew strongly in adoption,  library and corporate channels
and in the business  and finance,  culinary  and  hospitality  and  architecture
categories.  Wiley  Asia's  Higher  Education  business  picked up in the fourth
quarter, mainly driven by strong adoption sales in the sciences, mathematics and
engineering.

In Australia,  the Higher  Education and School  businesses both had a good year
due  to  the  strength  of  local   publishing,   while  P/T's  performance  was
disappointing,  as a result of a challenging retail environment. Wiley Australia
was once  again  awarded  the  Employer  of  Choice  citation  from the  Federal
Government's Equal Opportunity in the Workplace Agency. Earlier in the year, the
Australian  Campus  Booksellers   Association  and  the  Australian   Publishers
Association awarded Wiley Australia with Publisher of the Year awards.

In Canada, P/T sales exceeded  expectations as a result of improved sell-through
and lower returns at certain  retail,  online and  mass-market  accounts.  Solid
gains were realized in the For Dummies and STM book programs.  Higher  Education
had a difficult year in Canada, reflecting similar concerns and conditions as in
the U.S.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's cash and cash equivalents  balance was $60.8 million at the end of
fiscal year 2006,  compared with $89.4 million a year earlier.  Cash provided by
operating activities in fiscal year 2006 was $242.6 million compared with $243.5
million in the prior year.

Net income plus non-cash  items improved $43.4 million to $245.3 million and was
offset by lower cash provided from working capital.  Higher accounts receivable,
reflecting higher fourth quarter book sales; increased inventory purchases;  and
higher  income tax  payments,  net of refunds  were  partially  offset by higher
accounts and royalties  payable,  mainly due to business growth and timing;  and
higher accrued liabilities.

Pension  contributions in fiscal year 2006 were $7.0 million,  compared to $16.6
million in the prior year. The Company anticipates making pension  contributions
in fiscal year 2007 of approximately $15 million. Included within cash flow from
deferred subscription revenues is higher journal subscription collections offset
by a reduction of deferred revenue  reflecting the recognition of the prior year
subscription cash collections.

Cash used for  investing  activities  for fiscal  year 2006 was  $113.6  million
compared to $123.8  million in fiscal  year 2005.  The  Company  invested  $31.4
million in  acquisitions  of  publishing  assets and  rights  compared  to $22.5
million in the prior year. The current year acquisitions  included the assets of
Sybex Inc., a publisher of computer  books and software;  and InfoPOEM,  Inc., a
leading  provider  of  evidence-based  medicine  content;  rights to publish the
Journal of  Dialysis &  Transplantation,  a  controlled  circulation  renal care
journal;  and the  newsletter  publishing  division of  Manisses  Communications
Group, a leading publisher of mental health and addiction information.

Marketable  Securities  of $10 million were sold during the year  consisting  of
shares of variable rate securities issued by closed-end funds.

<PAGE>

An increase in cash used for product  development was partially  offset by lower
spending on property, equipment and technology. Additions to property, plant and
equipment in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 are  principally  computer  hardware and
software to support customer products and improve productivity.

Cash used for financing  activities  was $157.3  million in fiscal year 2006, as
compared  to $113.5  million in fiscal  year 2005.  Cash was used  primarily  to
purchase treasury stock, repay debt and pay dividends to shareholders.

On November 9, 2005, John Wiley and Sons,  Inc.  entered into a new $300 million
revolving credit agreement with Bank of America as  Administrative  Agent and 14
other lenders. The Company has the option of borrowing at the following floating
interest rates: (i) at a rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
plus an applicable  margin ranging from .37% to .825%  depending on the coverage
ratio of debt to  EBITDA;  or (ii) at the higher of (a) the  Federal  Funds Rate
plus 1/2 of 1% and (b) the rate of  interest  in effect for such day as publicly
announced  from time to time by Bank of  America  as its prime  rate;  and (iii)
LIBOR plus or minus an amount determined  through a competitive  bidding process
among the lenders. The maximum amount outstanding at any time under option (iii)
above cannot  exceed $25 million.  In addition,  the Company will pay a facility
fee ranging from .08% to .175% on the facility  depending on the coverage  ratio
of debt to EBITDA.  The  Company  has the option to request an increase of up to
$100 million in the size of the facility in minimum amounts of $25 million.  The
credit agreement contains certain restrictive  covenants similar to those in the
Company's prior credit agreements related to an interest coverage ratio,  funded
debt levels,  and restricted  payments,  including a limit on dividends paid and
share  repurchases.  The credit agreement will terminate on November 9, 2010. As
of April 30, 2006, $150.0 million was outstanding under the new agreement.

Simultaneous  with the execution of this agreement,  the Company  terminated its
previous credit  agreement and paid in full the amounts  outstanding  under that
agreement by utilizing funds from the new facility. In connection with the early
termination  of the credit  agreement  the  Company  wrote-off  $0.5  million of
unamortized origination fees in the third quarter.

Borrowings  this period,  including  those under the new credit  agreement  were
$303.8  million while  payments,  including  the paydown of the prior  revolving
credit and term loan facility were $336.3 million.  Included in this activity is
$50.0 million of borrowings  under its former revolving credit facility to repay
$50.0  million of the former  outstanding  term loan  facility in advance of the
scheduled  due date.  During  fiscal 2005 the  Company's  European  subsidiaries
entered into a multicurrency  revolving  credit facility under which $46 million
was borrowed during fiscal 2005.

Current year financing  activities  included the  continuation  of the Company's
stock repurchase  program as approximately  2,787,000 shares were repurchased at
an average  price of  approximately  $39.06.  On February  4, 2005,  the Company
repurchased  one  million  shares of its Class A stock at a price of $32.45  per
share from several entities associated with the Bass group of Fort Worth, Texas.
The transaction was paid out of existing cash balances.

The Company paid quarterly  dividends of $0.09 per share versus $0.075 per share
in the prior year.  Under the current share  repurchase  program approved by the
Company's Board of Directors in June of 2005, the Company has  authorization  to
purchase up to approximately 2.1 million additional shares of its Class A Common
Stock as of April 30, 2006.

The Company's  operating  cash flow is affected by the  seasonality  of its U.S.
Higher Education business and receipts from its journal  subscriptions.  Journal
receipts occur primarily  during  November and December from companies  commonly
referred to as journal subscription agents. Reference is made to the Credit Risk
section,  which  follows,  for a description  of the impact on the Company as it
relates to journal agents' financial  position and liquidity.  Sales in the U.S.
higher  education  market tend to be concentrated  in June through  August,  and
again in November through January. The Company normally requires increased funds
for working capital from May through  September.  Subject to variations that may
be  caused by  fluctuations  in  inventory  levels or in  patterns  of  customer
payments,  the Company's  operating cash flow is not expected to vary materially
in the near term.

<PAGE>

Working capital at April 30, 2006 was negative $35.8 million. Working capital is
negative as a result of  including,  in current  liabilities,  deferred  revenue
related to journal subscriptions for which cash has been received. This deferred
revenue  will be  recognized  into  income as the  journals  are shipped or made
available  online to the customers  over the term of the  subscription.  Current
liabilities  as of April  30,  2006  include  $143.9  million  of such  deferred
subscription revenue.

The  Company  has  adequate  cash and  cash  equivalents  available,  as well as
short-term  lines of credit to finance its short-term  seasonal  working capital
requirements. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet debt.

Projected  product  development and property,  equipment and technology  capital
spending  for fiscal year 2007 is forecast to be  approximately  $75 million and
$35 million,  respectively.  These  investments  will be funded  primarily  from
internal cash generation,  the liquidation of cash  equivalents,  and the use of
short-term lines of credit.

A summary of contractual  obligations and commercial commitments as of April 30,
2006 is as follows:

</TABLE>

Market Risk
- -----------

The  Company is exposed to market  risk  primarily  related to  interest  rates,
foreign  exchange,  and credit risk. It is the Company's policy to monitor these
exposures and to use derivative financial investments and/or insurance contracts
from time to time to reduce  fluctuations  in earnings and cash flows when it is
deemed  appropriate  to do so. The  Company  does not use  derivative  financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest Rates:

The Company had $160.5  million of variable rate loans  outstanding at April 30,
2006,  which  approximated  fair value.  The Company did not use any  derivative
financial  investments  to manage this  exposure.  A  hypothetical  1% change in
interest rates for this variable rate debt would affect net income and cash flow
by approximately $1.1 million.

Foreign Exchange Rates:

The Company is exposed to foreign  exchange  movements  primarily  in  sterling,
euros,  Canadian and Australian  dollars,  and certain Asian  currencies.  Under
certain   circumstances,   the  Company  may  enter  into  derivative  financial
instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts as a hedge against
specific transactions,  including inter-company  purchases. The Company does not
use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 the Company entered into derivative
contracts to hedge potential foreign currency  volatility on a portion of fiscal
year 2004  inventory  purchases  in Australia  and Canada.  The  contracts  were
designated as cash flow hedges. All of the derivative foreign exchange contracts
settled  during  fiscal year 2004  resulting  in a pretax loss of  approximately
$300,000,  which was  recognized  in cost of sales as the related  inventory was
sold. The Company did not enter into any other derivative contracts.

<PAGE>

Credit Risk:

The Company's  business is not dependent upon a single  customer;  however,  the
industry is concentrated in national,  regional,  and online  bookstore  chains.
Although no one book  customer  accounts for more than 7% of total  consolidated
revenue,  the top 10 book  customers  account  for  approximately  25% of  total
consolidated  revenue  and  approximately  46% of  total  gross  trade  accounts
receivable at April 30, 2006.

In the journal publishing business,  subscriptions are primarily sourced through
journal  subscription  agents  who,  acting as  agents  for  library  customers,
facilitate  ordering by consolidating the subscription  orders/billings  of each
subscriber with various publishers.  Cash is generally collected in advance from
subscribers by the subscription agents and is remitted to the journal publisher,
including the Company, generally prior to the commencement of the subscriptions.
Although at fiscal  year-end  the Company  had minimal  credit risk  exposure to
these agents,  future calendar-year  subscription receipts from these agents are
highly dependent on their financial condition and liquidity. Subscription agents
account for  approximately  17% of total  consolidated  revenue and no one agent
accounts for more than 7% of total  consolidated  revenue.  Insurance  for these
accounts is not commercially feasible and/or available.



Critical Accounting Policies
- ----------------------------

The  preparation  of the  Company's  financial  statements  in  conformity  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amount of  assets  and
liabilities,  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial  statements,  and reported  amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period.  Management continually evaluates the basis for its estimates;
however,  actual results could differ from those  estimates,  which could affect
the reported results from operations.


Financial  Reporting  Release No. 60,  released by the  Securities  and Exchange
Commission,  requires all companies to discuss critical  accounting  policies or
methods used in the preparation of financial  statements.  Note 2 of the " Notes
to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements"  includes a summary of the  significant
accounting  policies  and  methods  used  in  preparation  of  our  Consolidated
Financial  Statements.  Set forth below is a discussion  of the  Company's  more
critical accounting policies and methods.

Revenue  Recognition:  In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,
"Revenue  Recognition in Financial  Statements," the Company  recognizes revenue
when the following  criteria are met:  persuasive  evidence that an  arrangement
exists;  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;  the price to the
customer is fixed or determinable;  and collectibility is reasonably assured. If
all of the above criteria have been met, revenue is principally  recognized upon
shipment of products or when services have been rendered.  Subscription  revenue
is generally collected in advance, and is deferred and recognized as earned when
the  related  issue is shipped  or made  available  online  over the term of the
subscription.  Where a  product  has been sold with  multiple  deliverables  the
Company  follows  EITF No.  00-21  "Accounting  for Revenue  Relationships  with
Multiple   Deliverables"  to  determine  the  timing  of  revenue   recognition.
Collectibility is evaluated based on the amount involved,  the credit history of
the customer, and the status of the customer's account with the Company.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:  The estimated  allowance for doubtful accounts
is based on a review  of the  aging of the  accounts  receivable  balances,  the
historical  write-off  experience,  and a credit  evaluation of the customer.  A
change in the  evaluation  of a customer's  credit  could  affect the  estimated
allowance.  The  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts is shown as a  reduction  of
accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amounted
to $6.6 million and $7.3 million at April 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

<PAGE>

Sales Return  Reserve:  The estimated  allowance for sales returns is based on a
review of the  historical  return  patterns  associated  with the various  sales
outlets, as well as current market trends in the businesses in which we operate.
Sales  return  reserves,  net of  estimated  inventory  and royalty  costs,  are
reported as a reduction of accounts receivable in the Consolidated  Statement of
Financial  Position and amounted to $55.8 million and $56.7 million at April 30,
2006 and 2005, respectively.  A one percent change in the estimated sales return
rate could  affect net income by  approximately  $3.7  million.  A change in the
pattern or trends in returns could affect the estimated allowance.

Reserve for Inventory  Obsolescence:  Inventories  are carried at cost or market
whichever is lower. A reserve for inventory obsolescence is estimated based on a
review of damaged,  obsolete,  or  otherwise  unsaleable  inventory.  The review
encompasses  historical unit sales trends by title;  current market  conditions,
including  estimates of customer  demand;  and publication  revision  cycles.  A
change in sales  trends  could  affect  the  estimated  reserve.  The  inventory
obsolescence  reserve is reported as a reduction of the inventory balance in the
Consolidated  Statement of Financial  Position and amounted to $30.7 million and
$24.2 million as of April 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Allocation of  Acquisition  Purchase  Price to Assets  Acquired and  Liabilities
Assumed: In connection with acquisitions,  the Company allocates the cost of the
acquisition  to the  assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  based  on
estimates  of the  fair  value  of  such  items  including  goodwill  and  other
intangible assets. Such estimates include expected cash flows to be generated by
those  assets and the  expected  useful  lives based on  historical  experience,
current market  trends,  and synergies to be achieved from the  acquisition  and
expected tax basis of assets acquired. For major acquisitions,  the Company uses
independent appraisers to confirm the reasonableness of such estimates.

Goodwill  and Other  Intangible  Assets:  Goodwill is the excess of the purchase
price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the business acquired. Other
intangible  assets   principally   consist  of  branded   trademarks,   acquired
publication  rights and  non-compete  agreements.  In accordance  with SFAS 142,
goodwill and indefinite-lived  intangible assets are no longer amortized but are
reviewed  at  least  annually  for  impairment,  or  more  often  if  events  or
circumstances  occur which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount.  Other finite-lived  intangible assets
continue to be amortized over their useful lives.  Acquired  publication  rights
with  definitive  lives are  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis over  periods
ranging from 5 to 30 years.  Noncompete  agreements are amortized over the terms
of the individual agreement.

Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets:  Depreciable and  amortizable  assets are only
evaluated  for  impairment  upon  a  significant  change  in  the  operating  or
macroeconomic  environment.  In these  circumstances,  if an  evaluation  of the
undiscounted cash flows indicates  impairment,  the asset is written down to its
estimated fair value based on discounted future cash flow.



Recent Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) ("SFAS 123R")
"Share-Based  Payments."  SFAS 123R will require the Company to measure the cost
of   all    employee    stock-based    compensation    awards   based   on   the
grant-date-fair-value  and to record that cost as compensation  expense over the
period during which the employee is required to perform  service under the terms
of  the  award.  The  statement  requires  that  the  unvested  portion  of  all
outstanding  awards  upon  adoption be  recognized  using the fair value and the
attribution  methodologies  previously  determined under SFAS 123. The statement
eliminates the  alternative  method of accounting  for the employee  share-based
payments previously available under Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 25.

<PAGE>

In November 2005,  the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 123R-3,  Transition
Election  Related  to  Accounting  for the Tax  effects of  Share-Based  Payment
Awards,  which  provides  an  optional  short cut  method  for  calculating  the
historical  pool of tax  benefits  upon  adoption of FAS 123R.  The Company will
adopt FAS 123R,  and the FSP beginning in the Company's  first quarter of fiscal
year 2007. The company will continue to use the  Black-Scholes  valuation method
and will apply the modified  prospective  method. The magnitude of the impact of
adoption of SFAS 123R cannot be predicted at this time, as it will depend on the
levels of share-based  incentive awards granted in the future.  However, had the
Company  adopted  SFAS  123R in prior  periods,  the pro  forma  impact  of that
standard  would have  approximated  the impact of SFAS 123 as  described  in the
"Stock-Based Compensation" section of Note 2.

There have been no other new accounting pronouncements issued during fiscal year
2006  that  have  had,  or are  expected  to  have,  a  material  impact  on our
consolidated financial statements.



                        "Safe Harbor" Statement Under the
                Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

(a)  In the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2005,  the  Company  elected  to
     repatriate  approximately  $94  million  of  dividends  from  its  European
     subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which became law
     on October  2004.  The law  provided  for a favorable  one-time tax rate on
     dividends from foreign subsidiaries. The tax accrued on the dividend in the
     fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 was approximately $7.5 million, or $0.12
     per diluted  share.  Pursuant to guidance  issued by the  Internal  Revenue
     Service  in May 2005,  the  Company  recorded  a tax  benefit  in the first
     quarter of fiscal  year 2006  reversing  the  accrued  tax  recorded in the
     previous  year.  Neither the first quarter fiscal year 2006 tax benefit nor
     the  corresponding  fourth  quarter fiscal year 2005 tax accrual had a cash
     impact on the Company.

(b)  In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company  recognized a net tax
     benefit  of $6.8  million,  or $0.11  per  diluted  share,  related  to the
     settlement of certain matters with tax authorities.

(a)  In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 Wiley finalized its commitment to
     relocate the Company's  headquarters  to Hoboken,  N.J. The  relocation was
     completed in the first  quarter of fiscal year 2003.  The amounts  reported
     above  include  an  unusual  charge   associated  with  the  relocation  of
     approximately  $2.5  million,  or $1.5 million after tax equal to $0.02 per
     diluted share in fiscal year 2003, and $12.3 million, or $7.7 million after
     tax equal to $0.12 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2002.

(b)  At the  beginning  of fiscal year 2003,  the Company  adopted  Statement of
     Financial   Accounting   Standard  (SFAS)  No.  142:  "Goodwill  and  Other
     Intangible  Assets."  In  accordance  with SFAS No.  142,  amortization  of
     goodwill and indefinite life intangibles is discontinued.  Fiscal year 2002
     includes  amortization,  which is no longer  recorded of $9.6 million ($7.8
     million after-tax).

(c)  In the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2005,  the  Company  elected  to
     repatriate  approximately  $94  million  of  dividends  from  its  European
     subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which became law
     on October  2004.  The law  provided  for a favorable  one-time tax rate on
     dividends from foreign subsidiaries. The tax accrued on the dividend in the
     fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 was approximately $7.5 million, or $0.12
     per diluted  share.  Pursuant to guidance  issued by the  Internal  Revenue
     Service  in May 2005,  the  Company  recorded  a tax  benefit  in the first
     quarter of fiscal  year 2006  reversing  the  accrued  tax  recorded in the
     previous  year.  Neither the first quarter fiscal year 2006 tax benefit nor
     the  corresponding  fourth  quarter fiscal year 2005 tax accrual had a cash
     impact on the Company.

(d)  In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company  recognized a net tax
     benefit  of $6.8  million,  or $0.11  per  diluted  share,  related  to the
     favorable resolution of certain matters with tax authorities.

(e)  In fiscal  year 2004,  the  Company  recognized  a net tax  benefit of $3.0
     million, or $0.05 per diluted share, related to the favorable resolution of
     certain state and federal tax matters, and an adjustment to accrued foreign
     taxes.

(f)  Fiscal year 2003 includes a one-time tax benefit of $12.0 million, or $0.19
     per diluted share,  relating to an increase in the tax-deductible net asset
     basis of a European subsidiary's assets.

(g)  Working  capital is reduced or negative as a result of including in current
     liabilities the deferred revenue related to journal subscriptions for which
     the cash has been received.  The deferred  revenue will be recognized  into
     income  as the  journals  are  shipped  or  made  available  online  to the
     customers over the term of the subscription.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To The Board of Directors and Shareholders
of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  statements of financial position
of John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (the "Company") and subsidiaries as of April 30, 2006
and 2005,  and the  related  consolidated  statements  of income,  shareholders'
equity  and  comprehensive  income,  and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year  period ended April 30, 2006.  In  connection  with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements,  we also have audited the financial statement
schedule  (as  listed  in the  index to Item 8).  These  consolidated  financial
statements  and  financial  statement  schedule  are the  responsibility  of the
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
consolidated  financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of John Wiley & Sons,
Inc. and  subsidiaries  as of April 30, 2006 and 2005,  and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period
ended April 30, 2006,  in conformity  with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole,  presents  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the information set forth
therein.

We also have  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  the effectiveness of the Company's
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as of April  30,  2006,  based on
criteria  established in Internal  Control - Integrated  Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our
report dated June 28, 2006  expressed  an  unqualified  opinion on  management's
assessment of, and the effective  operation of, internal  control over financial
reporting.

           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON
                    INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING


The Board of Directors and Stockholders
John Wiley & Sons, Inc.:

We  have  audited   management's   assessment,   included  in  the  accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting that John Wiley
and Sons, Inc. (the "Company") and subsidiaries  maintained  effective  internal
control  over  financial  reporting  as of April  30,  2006,  based on  criteria
established in Internal  Control - Integrated  Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway  Commission  (COSO).  The Company's
management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control over
financial  reporting  and for its  assessment of the  effectiveness  of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's  assessment,  and an opinion on the  effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted  our audit in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all  material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting,  evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other  procedures as we considered  necessary in the  circumstances.  We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's  internal control over financial  reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting
and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the assets of the company;  (2)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or  disposition  of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,  management's  assessment that the Company maintained  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as of April 30,  2006,  is fairly
stated,  in all material  respects,  based on criteria  established  in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects,  effective internal control over financial
reporting  as of April 30,  2006,  based on  criteria  established  in  Internal
Control - Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States),  the  consolidated  statements of
financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated  statements  of  income,  shareholders'  equity  and  comprehensive
income,  and cash  flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period  ended
April 30,  2006,  and our report dated June 28, 2006  expressed  an  unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 - Description of Business

The  Company,  founded  in 1807,  was  incorporated  in the state of New York on
January 15, 1904.  (As used herein the term  "Company"  means John Wiley & Sons,
Inc.,  and  its  subsidiaries  and  affiliated  companies,  unless  the  context
indicates otherwise).

The Company is a global  publisher of print and electronic  products,  providing
content  to  customers  worldwide.  Core  businesses  include  professional  and
consumer books and subscription  products;  scientific,  technical,  and medical
journals,  encyclopedias,  books, and online products; and educational materials
for undergraduate and graduate students and lifelong  learners.  The Company has
publishing,  marketing,  and distribution centers in the United States,  Canada,
Europe, Asia, and Australia.


Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation:  The consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts  of the  Company.  Investments  in entities in which the Company has at
least a 20%,  but less than a majority  interest,  are  accounted  for using the
equity method of  accounting.  Investments  in entities in which the Company has
less  than a 20%  ownership  and in  which  it  does  not  exercise  significant
influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. All significant
intercompany  accounts and transactions  have been eliminated in  consolidation.
Certain  prior-year  amounts  have been  reclassified  to conform to the current
year's presentation.

Use of  Estimates:  The  preparation  of the Company's  financial  statements in
conformity with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts  of assets and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets and
liabilities  at the date of the  financial  statements  and reported  amounts of
revenue and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Revenue  Recognition:  In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,
"Revenue  Recognition in Financial  Statements," the Company  recognizes revenue
when the following  criteria are met:  persuasive  evidence that an  arrangement
exists;  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;  the price to the
customer is fixed or determinable;  and collectibility is reasonably assured. If
all of the above criteria have been met, revenue is principally  recognized upon
shipment of products or when services have been rendered.  Subscription  revenue
is generally collected in advance, and is deferred and recognized as earned when
the  related  issue is shipped  or made  available  online  over the term of the
subscription.  Where a  product  has been sold with  multiple  deliverables  the
Company  follows  EITF No.  00-21  "Accounting  for Revenue  Relationships  with
Multiple   Deliverables"  to  determine  the  timing  of  revenue   recognition.
Collectibility is evaluated based on the amount involved,  the credit history of
the customer, and the status of the customer's account with the Company.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:  The estimated  allowance for doubtful accounts
is based on a review  of the  aging of the  accounts  receivable  balances,  the
historical write-off experience, and a credit evaluation of a customer. A change
in the evaluation of a customer's  credit could affect the estimated  allowance.
The  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  is shown  as a  reduction  of  accounts
receivable in the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets and amounted to $6.6
million and $7.3 million at April 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Sales Return Reserves: The process which the Company uses to determine its sales
returns and the related  reserve  provision  charged against revenue is based on
applying an estimated return rate to current year sales. This rate is based upon
an analysis of actual  historical  return  experience in the various markets and
geographic  regions in which the Company does  business.  The Company  collects,
maintains  and  analyzes  significant  amounts of sales  returns  data for large
volumes of homogeneous transactions.  This allows the Company to make reasonable
estimates of the amount of future  returns.

<PAGE>

All available data is utilized to identify the returns by market and as to which
fiscal  year the sales  returns  apply.  This  enables  management  to track the
returns in detail and identify and react to trends occurring in the marketplace,
with the objective of being able to make the most informed judgments possible in
setting reserve rates.  Sales return  reserves,  net of estimated  inventory and
royalty  costs,  are  reported as a  reduction  of  accounts  receivable  in the
Consolidated  Statement of Financial  Position and amounted to $55.8 million and
$56.7 million at April 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Reserve for Inventory  Obsolescence:  Inventories are carried at cost or market,
whichever is lower. A reserve for inventory obsolescence is estimated based on a
review of damaged,  obsolete,  or  otherwise  unsaleable  inventory.  The review
encompasses  historical unit sales trends by title;  current market  conditions,
including  estimates of customer demand;  and publication  revision cycles.  The
inventory  obsolescence  reserve is  reported as a  reduction  of the  inventory
balance in the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Financial  Position and amounted to
$30.7 million and $24.2 million as of April 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Allocation of  Acquisition  Purchase  Price to Assets  Acquired and  Liabilities
Assumed: In connection with acquisitions,  the Company allocates the cost of the
acquisition  to the  assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  based  on
estimates  of the  fair  value  of  such  items  including  goodwill  and  other
intangible assets. Such estimates include expected cash flows to be generated by
those  assets and the  expected  useful  lives based on  historical  experience,
current market  trends,  and synergies to be achieved from the  acquisition  and
expected tax basis of assets acquired.  For major acquisitions,  the Company may
use an independent appraiser to confirm the reasonableness of such estimates.

Inventories:  Inventories are stated at cost or market, whichever is lower. U.S.
book inventories  aggregating  $67.0 million and $62.1 million at April 30, 2006
and 2005, respectively,  are valued using the last-in,  first-out (LIFO) method.
All other inventories are valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

Product  Development  Assets:  Product development assets consist of composition
costs and royalty  advances to authors.  Costs  associated  with  developing any
publication  are expensed  until the product is  determined  to be  commercially
viable. Composition costs, primarily representing the costs incurred to bring an
edited commercial manuscript to publication including typesetting, proofreading,
design and  illustration,  etc., are  capitalized  and generally  amortized on a
double-declining  basis over estimated useful lives,  ranging from 1 to 3 years.
Royalty advances to authors are capitalized and, upon publication, are recovered
as royalties are earned by the authors  based on sales of the  published  works.
Author advances are periodically  reviewed for  recoverability and a reserve for
loss is maintained, if appropriate.

Advertising Expense:  Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

Property,  Equipment  and  Technology:  Property,  equipment  and  technology is
recorded  at cost.  Major  renewals  and  improvements  are  capitalized,  while
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

Costs incurred for computer software  developed or obtained for internal use are
capitalized  during the application  development  stage and expensed as incurred
during the preliminary project and  post-implementation  stages.  Costs incurred
during  the  application  development  stage  include  costs  of  materials  and
services,  and payroll and payroll-related  costs for employees who are directly
associated with the software project. Such costs are amortized over the expected
useful  life  of the  related  software  generally  3 to 5  years.  Maintenance,
training, and upgrade costs that do not result in additional functionality,  are
expensed as incurred.

Buildings,  leasehold  improvements,  and capital  leases are amortized over the
lesser of the estimated  useful lives of the assets up to 40 years,  or over the
duration of the lease,  using the straight-line  method.  Furniture and fixtures
are depreciated  principally on the  straight-line  method over estimated useful
lives  ranging  from  3 to  10  years.  Computer  equipment  is  amortized  on a
straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 5 years.

<PAGE>

Goodwill  and Other  Intangible  Assets:  Goodwill is the excess of the purchase
price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the business acquired. Other
intangible  assets   principally   consist  of  brands,   trademarks,   acquired
publication  rights and non-compete  agreements.  Goodwill and  indefinite-lived
intangible  assets are not  amortized  but are  reviewed at least  annually  for
impairment,  or more  often if events or  circumstances  occur  that  would more
likely  than not reduce the fair  market  value of a  reporting  unit below its'
carrying amount.  The Company  evaluates the  recoverability of indefinite lived
intangible  assets by comparing  the fair value of the  intangible  asset to the
carrying value. For goodwill impairment,  the Company uses a two-step impairment
test approach at the reporting unit level.  In the first step the fair value for
the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill. In the case
that the fair value of the reporting  unit is less than the book value, a second
step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting  unit's
goodwill to the book value of the  goodwill.  The fair value for the goodwill is
determined  based on the  difference  between the fair  values of the  reporting
units and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such
reporting  units. If the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value,
the difference is recognized as an impairment.

Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Management
evaluates the estimated life of acquired  publication  rights (APR),  trademarks
and brands based upon SFAS 142. The most  significant  factor in determining the
life of these intangibles is the history and longevity of the brands, trademarks
or titles acquired,  combined with strong cash flows. Acquired publishing rights
that  have an  indefinite  life  are  typically  characterized  by  intellectual
property with a long and  well-established  revenue stream resulting from strong
and  well-established   imprint/brand   recognition  in  the  market.   Acquired
publication rights, trademarks and brands with definitive lives are amortized on
a  straight-line  basis over  periods  ranging  from 5 to 30 years.  Non-compete
agreements are amortized over the terms of the individual agreement.

Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets:  Depreciable and  amortizable  assets are only
evaluated  for  impairment  upon  a  significant  change  in  the  operating  or
macroeconomic  environment.  In these  circumstances,  if an  evaluation  of the
undiscounted cash flows indicates  impairment,  the asset is written down to its
estimated fair value based on discounted future cash flows.

Derivative Financial Instruments - Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Company, from
time to time, enters into forward exchange  contracts as a hedge against foreign
currency asset and liability commitments, and anticipated transaction exposures.
The Company accounts for its derivative  instruments in accordance with SFAS No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.
Accordingly,  all  derivatives  are  recognized  as  assets or  liabilities  and
measured at fair value.  Derivatives  that are not  determined  to be  effective
hedges are adjusted to fair value with a corresponding  effect on earnings.  The
Company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 the Company entered into derivative
contracts to hedge potential foreign currency  volatility on a portion of fiscal
year 2004 inventory purchases. The contracts were designated as cash flow hedges
and were considered by management to be highly effective.  All of the derivative
foreign exchange contracts settled during fiscal year 2004 resulted in a loss of
approximately  $300,000,  which was  recognized  in cost of sales as the related
inventory  was  sold.  The  Company  did not  enter  into any  other  derivative
contracts.

Foreign Currency Gains/Losses:  The Company translates the results of operations
of its  international  subsidiaries  using  average  exchange  rates during each
period,  whereas  balance sheet accounts are translated  using exchange rates at
the end of each  period.  Currency  translation  adjustments  are  recorded as a
component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income (loss) in  stockholders'
equity.

<PAGE>

Included in operating  and  administrative  expenses  were net foreign  exchange
transaction  losses/(gains) of approximately $0.2 million,  $(1.8) million,  and
$1.4 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Stock-Based  Compensation:   Stock  options  and  restricted  stock  grants  are
accounted for in accordance  with  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and the  disclosure-only  provisions
of SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation," as amended by SFAS
No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation - Transition and Disclosure."
Accordingly,  the Company  recognizes  no  compensation  expense for fixed stock
option grants since the exercise  price is equal to the fair value of the shares
at date of grant.  For restricted stock grants,  compensation  cost is generally
recognized ratably over the vesting period based on the fair value of shares.

The fair value of the awards was  estimated at the date of grant using the Black
Scholes  option-pricing  model.  The per  share  value  of  options  granted  in
connection  with the Company's  stock option plans has been  estimated  with the
following weighted average assumptions:

</TABLE>
The Company discloses pro forma  compensation  expense  reflecting stock options
granted to all  employees,  including  near-retirement  and  retirement-eligible
employees.  Upon the adoption of SFAS 123R,  in the first quarter of fiscal year
2007,  compensation expense will be recognized over the requisite service period
to achieve vesting for awards granted to  retirement-eligible  employees,  which
may be shorter than the normal  vesting  period.  If the Company had  previously
been computing pro forma compensation expense over the shorter requisite service
period for stock options granted to retirement-eligible employees, the effect on
pro forma  earnings per share,  for all periods  presented,  would not have been
significant.

Cash  Equivalents:  Cash equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments that
mature within three months or less and are stated at cost plus accrued interest,
which approximates market value.

Recent Accounting Standards: In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123
(revised 2004) ("SFAS 123R") "Share-Based  Payments." SFAS 123R will require the
Company to measure  the cost of all  employee  stock-based  compensation  awards
based on the  grant-date-fair-value  and to  record  that  cost as  compensation
expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service
under the terms of the award.

<PAGE>

The statement  requires that the unvested portion of all outstanding awards upon
adoption be recognized  using the fair value and the  attribution  methodologies
previously  determined under SFAS 123. The statement  eliminates the alternative
method of accounting for the employee  share-based payments previously available
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25.

In November 2005,  the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 123R-3,  Transition
Election  Related  to  Accounting  for the Tax  effects of  Share-Based  Payment
Awards,  which  provides  an  optional  short cut  method  for  calculating  the
historical  pool of tax  benefits  upon  adoption of FAS 123R.  The Company will
adopt FAS 123R,  and the FSP beginning in the Company's  first quarter of fiscal
year 2007. The Company will continue to use the  Black-Scholes  valuation method
and will apply the modified  prospective  method. The magnitude of the impact of
adoption of SFAS 123R cannot be predicted at this time, as it will depend on the
levels of share-based  incentive awards granted in the future.  However, had the
Company  adopted  SFAS  123R in prior  periods,  the pro  forma  impact  of that
standard  would have  approximated  the impact of SFAS 123 as  described  in the
"Stock-Based Compensation" section of Note 2.

There have been no other new accounting pronouncements issued during fiscal year
2006 that have had, or are expected to have, a material  impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

would have been antidilutive.


Note 4 - Acquisitions

Tax Charge (Credit) on Repatriated Foreign Dividends:  During the fourth quarter
of fiscal year 2005, the Company elected to repatriate approximately $94 million
of dividends  from foreign  subsidiaries  under the American  Jobs  Creation Act
(AJCA) of 2004. The law provides for a favorable  one-time tax rate on dividends
from  foreign  subsidiaries.  The tax accrued on these  dividends in fiscal year
2005 was approximately $7.5 million. Pursuant to guidance issued by the Internal
Revenue  Service in May 2005,  the  Company  recorded a tax benefit in the first
quarter of fiscal year 2006  reversing  the accrued tax recorded in the previous
year.   Neither  the  first  quarter  fiscal  year  2006  tax  benefit  nor  the
corresponding  fourth  quarter fiscal year 2005 tax accrual had a cash impact on
the Company.

Tax Adjustments: In fiscal years 2006 and 2004 the Company reported tax benefits
of $6.8 million and $3.0 million related to the favorable  resolution of certain
federal, state and foreign tax matters with tax authorities.

Deferred taxes result from temporary  differences in the  recognition of revenue
and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. The significant components
of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  at  April  30 were as  follows  (in

The AJCA  created  a  onetime  incentive  for U.S.  corporations  to  repatriate
undistributed  international  earnings by  providing an 85%  dividends  received
deduction. Other than these repatriated earnings the Company intends to continue
to reinvest earnings outside the U.S. for the foreseeable future and, therefore,
have not recognized any U.S. tax expense on foreign earnings. At April 30, 2006,
the  undistributed  earnings of international  subsidiaries  approximated  $47.6
million and, if remitted currently, would result in $3.7 million tax.

On  November 9, 2005,  the Company  entered  into a new $300  million  revolving
credit  agreement  with Bank of  America  as  Administrative  Agent and 14 other
lenders.  The  Company has the option of  borrowing  at the  following  floating
interest rates: (i) at a rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
plus an applicable  margin ranging from .37% to .825%  depending on the coverage
ratio of debt to  EBITDA;  or (ii) at the higher of (a) the  Federal  Funds Rate
plus 1/2 of 1% and (b) the rate of  interest  in effect for such day as publicly
announced  from time to time by Bank of  America  as its prime  rate;  and (iii)
LIBOR plus or minus an amount determined  through a competitive  bidding process
among the lenders. The maximum amount outstanding at any time under option (iii)
above cannot  exceed $25 million.  In addition,  the Company will pay a facility
fee ranging from .08% to .175% on the facility  depending on the coverage  ratio
of debt to EBITDA.  The  Company  has the option to request an increase of up to
$100 million in the size of the facility in minimum amounts of $25 million.  The
credit agreement contains certain restrictive  covenants similar to those in the
Company's former credit agreements related to an interest coverage ratio, funded
debt levels,  and restricted  payments,  including a limit on dividends paid and
share  repurchases.  The credit agreement will terminate on November 9, 2010. At
April 30, 2006, $150 million was outstanding under this agreement.

Simultaneous  with the execution of this agreement,  the Company  terminated its
previous credit  agreement and paid in full the amounts  outstanding  under that
agreement.  In connection  with the early  termination of the credit  agreement,
$0.5 million of unamortized origination fees were expensed in fiscal year 2006.

On April 21, 2005, the Company's  subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Germany
became  co-borrowers  under a  multi-currency  revolving credit agreement with a
face value of (pound)50  million with the Royal Bank of Scotland that expires in
April 2009. The bank's commitment  decreases each year on the anniversary of the
agreement so that amounts outstanding cannot exceed the following (in millions):

Above  amounts  have been  translated  at the April 30, 2006 US  dollar/Sterling
exchange rate of 1.825

The interest rate on each borrowing under the  multi-currency  revolving  credit
agreement  is based on the London  Interbank  Offered  Rate (or, for any loan in
euros, the Euro Interbank  Offered Rate) plus an applicable  margin ranging from
..50% to 1.25% depending on the coverage ratio of debt to EBITDA. In addition,  a
commitment  fee  ranging  from  .125% to .3125%  on the  unused  portion  of the
facility,  depending  on the  coverage  ratio of debt to  EBITDA,  is  incurred.
Borrowings under the agreement are guaranteed by John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

In the event of a change of control,  as  defined,  the banks have the option to
terminate the agreements and require repayment of any amounts outstanding.

The credit agreements  contain certain  restrictive  covenants related to funded
debt levels,  an interest coverage ratio, and restricted  payments,  including a
limitation for dividends paid and share repurchases.  Under the most restrictive
covenant,  approximately  $425.0  million  was  available  for  such  restricted
payments as of April 30, 2006.

The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  have  other  short-term  lines  of  credit
aggregating $33 million at various  interest rates. No amounts were  outstanding
at April 30, 2006, 2005 or 2004. Information relating to all short-term lines of

The  Company's  total  available  lines of  credit  as of April  30,  2006  were
approximately  $410 million.  The weighted  average  interest rates on long term
debt  outstanding  during  fiscal  years  2006 and 2005 were  4.24%  and  2.77%,
respectively. As of April 30, 2006 and 2005, the weighted average interest rates
for the long-term debt were 4.79% and 3.30% respectively.  Based on estimates of
interest rates  currently  available to the Company for loans with similar terms
and maturities,  the fair value of notes payable and long-term debt approximates
the carrying value.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Future minimum  payments under  operating  leases  aggregated  $195.6 million at
April  30,  2006.   Future  annual  minimum  payments  under  these  leases  are
approximately $27.4 million,  $25.7 million,  $25.1 million,  $24.1 million, and
$17.7 million for fiscal years 2007 through 2011,  respectively.  Future minimum
rentals to be received under non-cancelable  subleases aggregate $6.4 million at
April 30,  2006.  Rent expense  associated  with  operating  leases that include
scheduled  rent  increases  and tenant  incentives,  such as rent  holidays,  is
recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

The Company is  involved in routine  litigation  in the  ordinary  course of its
business.  In the opinion of management,  the ultimate resolution of all pending
litigation  will not have a material  effect  upon the  financial  condition  or
results of operations of the Company.


Note 14 - Retirement Plans

The Company and its principal subsidiaries have contributory and noncontributory
retirement  plans that cover  substantially  all employees.  The plans generally
provide for  employee  retirement  between  the ages of 60 and 65, and  benefits
based on length of service and compensation, as defined.

In fiscal year 2005, the U.S.  retirement  plan was amended to change the method
used  to  compute  retirement  benefits.  The new  formula  applies  to  current
compensation  (as  defined)  whereas  the  previous  formula  was based upon the
highest average  compensation for the three consecutive years ended December 31,
1997.  Benefits accrued through December 31, 2004 under the "previous" plan were
frozen as of that date, and are  supplemented  annually by additions  calculated
under a new formula.  The effect of this change was to increase  pre-tax pension
expense  for fiscal  year 2005 by $0.5  million,  $0.2  million  after-tax.  The
pre-tax effect, for fiscal year 2006 is approximately $1.5 million, $1.0 million
after-tax.

Net  pension  expense  included  below  for  international   plans  amounted  to
approximately  $7.1  million,  $6.7 million and $6.3 million for 2006,  2005 and
2004, respectively.

The Company has  agreements  with certain  officers and senior  management  that
provide for the payment of supplemental  retirement  benefits during each of the
10 years after the  termination  of  employment.  Under  certain  circumstances,
including a change of control as defined,  the payment of such amounts  could be
accelerated on a present value basis.

The investment  guidelines for the defined benefit pension plans are established
based upon an  evaluation  of market  conditions  and  tolerance  for risk.  Our
investment  objective  is to ensure that funds are  available to meet the plan's
benefit  obligations when they are due. Our investment  strategy is to prudently
invest in plan  assets in high  quality  diversified  securities  to achieve our
long-term expectation.  The plans' risk management practices provide guidance to
the investment managers,  including  guidelines for asset concentration,  credit
rating and  liquidity.  Asset  allocation  favors a balanced  portfolio,  with a
target  allocation  of  approximately  55% equity  securities,  40% fixed income
securities,  and 5% real estate.  Due to  volatility  in the market,  the target
allocation is not always desirable and asset  allocations will fluctuate between
acceptable ranges.

The expected  long-term rates of return were estimated  using market  benchmarks
for  equities,  real  estate,  and bonds  applied to each  plan's  target  asset
allocation.  Expected returns are estimated by asset class and represent the sum
of  expected  real rates of return  plus  anticipated  inflation.  The  expected
long-term rates are then compared to actual historic  investment  performance of
the plan assets and evaluated through consultation with investment advisors.

Expected  employer  contributions  in fiscal  year 2007 to the  defined  benefit
pension plans are approximately  $15 million,  including $7.5 million of minimum
legal amounts required for the Company's international plans. From time to time,
the Company may elect to make  voluntary  contributions  to its defined  benefit
plans to improve their funded status.

Expected  benefit  payments  from all plans are  expected  to  approximate  $7.4
million in fiscal year 2007,  $8.6 million in fiscal year 2008,  $8.8 million in
fiscal year 2009,  $9.1 million in fiscal year 2010, $9.3 million in fiscal year
2011, and $62.1 million for fiscal years 2012 through 2016.

The Company  provides  contributory  life  insurance  and health care  benefits,
subject to certain dollar  limitations for substantially all of its retired U.S.
employees.  The cost of such  benefits is expensed  over the years the  employee
renders service and is not funded in advance.  The  accumulated  post-retirement
benefit  obligation  as of April  30,  2006 and 2005 was $2.5  million  and $2.0
million,  respectively.  Annual  expenses  for these  plans  for all years  were
immaterial.

The Company has defined  contribution savings plans. The Company contribution is
based on employee  contributions and the level of Company match. The expense for
these plans  amounted to  approximately  $4.1 million,  $2.7  million,  and $2.9
million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.


Note 15 - Equity Compensation Plans

All equity  compensation plans have been approved by security holders. In fiscal
year 2005,  the  shareholders  approved the 2004 Key Employee  Stock Plan ("2004
Plan") to replace the Company's prior Long Term Incentive  Plan.  Under the 2004
Plan,  qualified employees are eligible to receive awards that may include stock
options,  performance-based stock awards, and restricted stock awards. Under the
2004 Plan, a maximum number of 8,000,000  shares of Company Class A stock may be
issued.  No more than 600,000  shares to any one  individual  may be issued in a
year.  As of April 30,  2006,  there were no remaining  securities  to be issued
under the Company's  prior Long Term  Incentive  Plan and  6,830,284  securities
remaining available for future issuance under the 2004 Plan.

<PAGE>

The exercise  price of options  granted under the plan may not be less than 100%
of the  fair  market  value  of the  stock at the  date of  grant.  Options  are
exercisable, in part or in full, over a maximum period of 10 years from the date
of grant,  and  generally  vest  within four and five years from the date of the
grant. Under certain circumstances  relating to a change of control, as defined,
the right to exercise options outstanding could be accelerated.

Under the terms of the Company's  executive  long-term incentive plans, upon the
achievement of certain three-year financial  performance-based  targets,  awards
are payable in  restricted  shares of the Company's  Class A Common  Stock.  The
restricted  shares vest 50% on the first and second  anniversary  date after the
award is earned. Compensation expense is charged to earnings over the respective
three-year period.

The Company also grants  restricted shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock
to key employees in connection  with their  employment.  The  restricted  shares
generally  vest one half at the end of the fourth and fifth years  following the
date of the grant. Under certain  circumstances  relating to a change of control
or termination,  as defined,  the restrictions would lapse and shares would vest
earlier. Compensation expense is charged to earnings ratably over five years, or
sooner if vesting is  accelerated,  from the dates of grant.  Restricted  shares
issued in  connection  with the above plans  amounted  to  154,952,  129,647 and
177,605 shares at weighted average fair values of $36.91, $32.13, and $25.16 per
share in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Under the terms of the Company's 1990 Director Stock Plan (the "1990 Plan"),  as
amended and restated as of June 2001,  each member of the Board of Directors who
was not an employee of the Company was awarded  either (a) Class A Common  Stock
equal to 50% of the board  member's  annual fee, based on the stock price on the
date of grant,  or (b) stock  options equal to 150% of the annual fee divided by
the  stock  price on the date of  grant.  Directors'  stock  options  were  100%
exercisable at date of grant.

<PAGE>

In  September  2004 the  shareholders  approved a new  Director  Stock Plan (the
"Director  Plan").  Under  the terms of the  Director  Plan,  each  non-employee
director  will receive an annual award of Class A Common Stock equal in value to
100% of the annual  director fee, based on the stock price on the date of grant.
The  granted  shares  may  not be  sold  or  transferred  during  the  time  the
non-employee  director  remains a director.  No further shares or options can be
granted under the 1990 Plan as of September 2005.

Directors  may also elect to receive all or a portion of their  director fees in
Company stock. No shares were issued in lieu of cash compensation for any of the
years presented.

In fiscal year 2006, 7,608 shares of Class A Common Stock were issued under the
Director Stock Plan. In fiscal years 2005 and 2004, 4,498 and 4,109 shares of
Class A Common Stock were issued under the 1990 Plan, respectively.

(b) Relocation related expenses

Intersegment  sales are  generally  made at a fixed  discount  from list  price.
Shared services costs are not allocated, as they support the Company's worldwide
operations.   Corporate  assets   primarily   consist  of  cash  and  marketable
securities,  deferred tax benefits,  and certain property and equipment.  Export
sales from the United States to unaffiliated international customers amounted to
approximately  $79.6 million,  $67.7 million,  and $68.8 million in fiscal years
2006,  2005,  and  2004,  respectively.   The  pretax  income  for  consolidated
operations  outside the United States was  approximately  $51.4  million,  $45.5
million, and $41.9 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures
          -----------------------

          Disclosure  Controls  and  Procedures:  As of the  end  of the  period
          covered  by  this  report,  an  evaluation  was  performed  under  the
          supervision and with the  participation  of the Company's  management,
          including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,  of
          the  effectiveness  of the  design  and  operation  of  the  Company's
          disclosure  controls  and  procedures  as such term is defined in Rule
          13a-15(e) of the Exchange  Act.  Based on that  evaluation,  the Chief
          Executive  Officer  and Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that the
          Company's   disclosure  controls  and  procedures  were  effective  in
          alerting them on a timely basis to information required to be included
          in our submissions and filings with the SEC.

          Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting:  Our
          Management is responsible for  establishing  and maintaining  adequate
          internal control over financial reporting,  as such term is defined in
          Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
          participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
          and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  we  conducted  an  evaluation  of the
          effectiveness of our internal  control over financial  reporting based
          upon the framework in Internal  Control - Integrated  Framework issued
          by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring   Organizations   of  the  Treadway
          Commission.  Based on that evaluation,  our management  concluded that
          our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of April
          30, 2006.

          KPMG LLP,  an  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm,  has
          audited the consolidated  financial statements included in this Annual
          Report on Form 10-K and,  as part of their  audit,  has  issued  their
          report,  included herein,  (1) on our  management's  assessment of the
          effectiveness  of our internal  controls over financial  reporting and
          (2) on  the  effectiveness  of our  internal  control  over  financial
          reporting.

          Changes in Internal  Control over Financial  Reporting:  There were no
          changes in our internal  control over  financial  reporting  that have
          materially  affected,  or are reasonably likely to materially  affect,
          our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal
          quarter of 2006.

                                      LEASE
                                      -----

     THIS LEASE (this  "Lease")  is made and  entered  into as of the 7th day of
June,  2006, by and between One Wiley Drive LLC, a New Jersey limited  liability
company,  ("Landlord")  and John  Wiley & Sons,  Inc.,  a New  York  corporation
("Tenant").

     NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual promises of the parties and
other good and valuable consideration,  the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties covenant and agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE ONE

                   LEASED PREMISES AND TERM / TENANT PROPERTY
                   ------------------------------------------

     1.  Landlord  hereby leases to Tenant and Tenant hereby rents from Landlord
that  certain  real  property  described  on  Exhibit  "A",  together  with  all
easements,  rights,  licenses and privileges  appurtenant thereto (collectively,
the "Land"),  together  with that certain  existing  building  (the  "Building")
containing  185,100  square  feet  located at One Wiley Drive in  Somerset,  New

"Term") of this Lease shall be for a period of fourteen (14) years commencing on

agreement(s)  (as required in Article 17 below) and (ii) January 1, 2007. If the
Commencement Date has not occurred by January 1, 2007 due to Landlord's  failure
to obtain the required  acceptable  non-disturbance  agreement(s)  then, in such
event,  and in addition to any and all other  rights and  remedies  available to
Tenant under this Lease,  at law and/or in equity,  Tenant shall have the option
of terminating this Lease by delivering notice thereof.  If Tenant delivers such
notice,  this  Lease  shall  terminate  as of the  thirtieth  (30th)  day  after
Landlord's  receipt of such notice unless,  prior to the end of such thirty (30)
day  period,   Landlord   delivers  to  Tenant  an  acceptable   non-disturbance
agreement(s)  (as  required  in  Article  17  below),  in  which  case  Tenant's
termination  shall be null and void and this Lease shall  continue in full force
and effect.

     2.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing or any contrary  provision  contained in
this Lease (and without otherwise  limiting any other items which may belong to,
and are considered to be owned by, Tenant),  the parties  expressly  acknowledge
that those  items set forth on Exhibit  "B"  attached to this Lease which may be
located at the Leased  Premises  (whether or not  attached or affixed)  shall be
considered Tenant's sole and exclusive property and, in this regard,  Tenant, as
Tenant may from time to time desire, may remove any or all of those items listed
on Exhibit "B" at any time without payment to Landlord.

                                REAL ESTATE TAXES
                                -----------------

     1. Except as provided below in this Article 3, Tenant will, at Tenant's own
cost and expense,  be responsible  for the payment of all taxes and  assessments
and other  charges,  ordinary  or  extraordinary  (all of which are  hereinafter
sometimes  collectively  referred to as  "Impositions"),  which shall be levied,
charged,  assessed or imposed  upon the Leased  Premises,  or any part  thereof,
which are  attributable  to the Term of this Lease.  In this regard,  subject to
Landlord's  timely  delivery to Tenant of all tax bills and assessment  bills as
required below,  Tenant shall pay for such impositions  before the assessment of
any  penalties.  Tenant  agrees to furnish to  Landlord,  at least ten (10) days
prior to the date any penalties or interest would be assessed,  proof of payment
of all Impositions.  If Tenant does not timely pay all Impositions in accordance
with this Article,  Landlord shall have the right,  after first providing Tenant
with written notice, to pay such sums and to collect from Tenant the entire cost
of all such sums advanced.

     2.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if, (i) pursuant to Article 23 of this
Lease,  Landlord  constructs  an Additional  Building on the Leased  Premises or
expands the Building  (collectively,  "Landlord's  Construction")  on the Leased
Premises,  (ii) Landlord's  Construction  is not for the benefit of Tenant,  and
(iii) as a result of such  construction  the  assessed  value of the Building is
increased (as determined by the tax assessor's notes),  then, except as provided
below, any increase in Impositions above the Impositions payable with respect to
the  Building  for the real  estate tax year  immediately  preceding  Landlord's
Construction  which  results  from such  increase in the  assessed  value of the
Building as opposed to an increase in the applicable  tax rate (the  "Landlord's
Construction  Increase"),  shall not be the  obligation  of Tenant and  Landlord
shall  pay  Landlord's  Construction  Increase  on or  before  the date on which
Impositions are due and payable.  Once  Impositions  payable with respect to the
Leased  Premises are  increased as a result of any  increase  applicable  to all
properties  similar to the Leased  Premises in Somerset,  New Jersey,  or if the
assessed value of the  Improvements are increased as a result of construction by
Tenant  pursuant to Articles 8 or 24 of this Lease,  then Tenant  shall pay such
Impositions as provided in this Article 3.

     3. Tenant shall pay all  Impositions  during the Term hereof on a quarterly
basis. Immediately upon receipt of all tax bills and assessment bills attributed
to any calendar year during the Term hereof,  Landlord shall furnish Tenant with
a written  statement of the actual amount of the  Impositions  for such year, or
part thereof,  together with a copy of such tax bills, and Tenant shall pay such
actual amount as provided above (and Landlord shall also be responsible  for any
additional  assessments,  fees or penalties incurred if Landlord fails to timely
deliver such bills).  Tenant may, upon the receipt of prior written  approval of
Landlord,  such approval not to be  unreasonably  withheld,  and provided Tenant
pays such Impositions,  contest any Impositions  against the Leased Premises and
attempt to obtain a reduction in the assessed valuation upon the Leased Premises
for the  purpose of  reducing  any such tax  assessment.  In the event  Landlord
approves  and upon the request of Tenant,  but without  expense or  liability to
Landlord,  Landlord  shall  cooperate with Tenant and execute any document which
may be reasonably necessary and proper for any proceeding. If a tax reduction is
obtained,  there shall be a subsequent  reduction in Tenant's  total  payment of
Impositions  for such year, and any refund of Impositions  received by Landlord,
less Landlord's  costs of obtaining such refunds,  if any, shall be delivered to
Tenant to the extent  that such  refund  applies to  Impositions  paid by Tenant
during the Term of this Lease.

Additional Building (as discussed in this Lease in more detail below).

                     REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE / CAPITAL FUND
                     --------------------------------------

     1. Tenant shall,  at Tenant's own cost and expense  (except for  Landlord's
contribution  to  the  cost  of  the  Capital   Improvements  as  set  forth  in
Subparagraph 2 of this Article 8, make all repairs and/or replacements  promptly

     Landlord has the right during normal business hours and after providing
Tenant with five (5) days prior written  notice  (except in case of emergency in
which case Landlord can enter at any time) to enter the Leased  Premises for the
purpose of inspection by Landlord or any Fee Mortgagee,  provided  Landlord does
not interfere  with  Tenant's use of all or any part of the Leased  Premises and
provided  further  a  representative  of  Tenant  shall be  present  during  all
inspections  made pursuant to this Article.  Tenant shall make a  representative
available for all such inspections.

                                   ALTERATIONS
                                  ------------

     1. Tenant may from time to time, at its own expense,  alter,  renovate,  or
improve all or any part of the Leased Premises  provided  Landlord has consented
to such alteration,  renovation or improvement (collectively,  an "Alteration"),
which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned or delayed. Such
Alteration  shall be performed in a good and  workmanlike  manner in  accordance
with all Laws,  and in  accordance  with plans and  specifications  approved  by
Landlord,  which approval  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned or
delayed.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Tenant  has the right to make  Minor
Alterations (as hereinafter  defined) to the Leased Premises  without  obtaining
Landlord's  prior written consent (but Tenant will provide  Landlord with notice
accompanied by any plans and specifications  which may have been prepared or, if
none  were  prepared,  then  with  by a  narrative  description  of  such  Minor
Alteration)  (by email to an address to be  designated  by  Landlord)  if Tenant
performs any such Minor  Alteration).  "Minor  Alterations" means Alterations to
the Leased  Premises the cost of which are not in excess of $250,000.00 or which

Lease.

Tenant's  interest in this Lease and/or the Leased Premises,  in any such event,
to a third  party (or  parties),  in  Tenant's  sole  discretion  (and upon such
assignment,  sublet or  transfer,  Tenant shall  notify  Landlord),  all without
Landlord's  consent.  No such transfer by Tenant shall  release  Tenant from any
liability of "Tenant" under this Lease.  Additionally,  Tenant, in Tenant's sole
discretion,  may, upon notice to Landlord, mortgage or grant a security interest
in  this  Lease  and/or  in any  improvement,  furniture,  fixtures,  equipment,
inventory  and all other  property  belonging  to  Tenant,  and may also  assign

                            SURRENDER AT END OF TERM
                            ------------------------

     1. Tenant agrees that at the time of expiration or earlier  termination  of
this Lease, Tenant will at its sole cost and expense:

          (a)  deliver the Leased  Premises  to  Landlord  in the same  physical
condition  and repair as existed on the  Commencement  Date,  ordinary  wear and
tear,  condemnation,  casualty or acts of  Landlord  or those  under  Landlord's
control excepted; and

          (b) at the sole option of Tenant, remove any or all installations,
improvements  and  Alterations  that Tenant has made to or at all or any part of
the Leased Premises.  Upon removal,  Tenant will repair any damage to the Leased
Premises caused solely by its installation and/or removal.

     2. Tenant may remove (but shall not be required to remove) any of its trade
fixtures,  furnishings and equipment, provided that Tenant repairs any damage to
the Leased Premises caused solely by its installation and/or removal.

                                ARTICLE THIRTEEN

                                    CASUALTY
                                    --------

     1.   (a)In case of damage to or total or partial destruction (other than by
reason  of  condemnation  proceedings)  of the  Leased  Premises,  Tenant  shall
promptly  notify  Landlord of such  damage or  destruction  and  Tenant,  at its
expense  (whether or not the net insurance  proceeds are sufficient to cover the
cost thereof),  promptly and with due diligence shall restore,  replace, repair,
rebuild or alter the damaged or  destroyed  portions  of the Leased  Premises as
nearly as practicable to their condition and character immediately prior to such
damage or destruction. Such restoration,  replacement, repair and rebuilding are
sometimes referred to in this Article as the "work."

          (b) If, any casualty  occurs  during the last two(2) years of the Term
     and the  restoration of the Leased  Premises is estimated to take more than
     180 days by a  licensed,  reputable,  independent  contractor  approved  by
     Landlord and Tenant,  or  completion of the  restoration  exceeds 180 days,
     then Tenant,  at its election,  may terminate  this Lease by giving written
     notice to Landlord specifying a termination date therein given within sixty
     (60)  days  following  such  casualty.  In such  event,  this  Lease  shall
     terminate on the date specified in such notice of  termination  (which date
     shall be no less than  thirty  (30) and no more than  forty-five  (45) days
     after the date of such notice) and (i) Tenant shall quit and  surrender the
     Leased  Premises to Landlord on or before such date in accordance with this
     Lease,  and  (ii)  Base  Rent,  Impositions  and all  other  items  of rent
     (collectively,  "Rent") shall be  apportioned  to such date. In such event,
     Landlord  shall be entitled to receive  and retain all  insurance  proceeds
     which relate to the Building  ("Building  Proceeds")  rather than  Tenant's
     furnishings, fixtures, equipment, inventory and Improvements (collectively,
     "Tenant's  FF&E") which should be paid to Tenant as a result of such damage
     or destruction  and Tenant shall have no interest in the Building  Proceeds
     and shall  assign (and hereby  does  assign) all of its rights  therein and
     thereto,  unto  Landlord,  except that Tenant  shall be entitled to receive
     from such proceeds,  reimbursement of reasonable  amounts expended by it in
     attempting to cure a condition resulting from such casualty which (1) posed
     an imminent  threat to the health and safety of the occupants of the Leased
     Premises or (2) exposed Tenant to criminal liability (of which expenditures
     Tenant shall furnish notice to Landlord before such expenditures are made),
     provided  that Tenant shall not be entitled to receive such proceeds if the
     payment to Tenant reduces the insurance  proceeds  payable to Landlord.  In
     the event the conditions set forth in the foregoing  subparagraphs  (i) and
     (ii) are satisfied, this Lease shall be deemed terminated and of no further
     force and effect and Tenant shall be relieved of any liability  pursuant to
     this Lease from and after such termination date provided that Tenant is not
     then in default  under this  Lease  beyond  applicable  grace  periods  and
     provided  further  that  Tenant  shall pay to  Landlord  the  amount of any
     deductibles under Tenant's insurance  policies.  The provisions hereof with
     respect  to  such  insurance  proceeds  shall  survive  the  expiration  or
     termination  of  this  Lease.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary
     contained  above,  if  Tenant  terminates  this  Lease due to the fact that
     completion of the restoration exceeds 180 days, Tenant's  termination shall
     be  nullified  and this Lease  shall  continue  in full force and effect if
     Landlord  completes  such  restoration  within  thirty  (30) days after its
     receipt of Tenant's termination notice. If Tenant does not give such notice
     of termination as hereinabove provided,  Tenant shall promptly proceed with
     the work in accordance with the terms of this Lease.

<PAGE>

          (c) In the  event  that  this  Lease  is not  terminated  pursuant  to
Subparagraph  (b) above  and  following  the  estimated  completion  date of the
restoration  of the Leased  Premises the Term  contains less than two (2) years,
then upon  completion  of such  restoration,  this Lease shall be  automatically
extended  so that  the Term  shall  expire  on the  last  day of the 24th  month
following the completi on of the restoration of the Leased Premises.

     2. If any  casualty  occurs  during  the last  year of the Term and  Tenant
determines, in its reasonable discretion, that the Leased Premises can no longer
be operated as a viable  economic unit following such casualty,  then Tenant may
terminate this Lease effective  thirty (30) days after Tenant notifies  Landlord
of Tenant's determination.  Upon such termination, Landlord shall be entitled to
receive and retain all  Building  Proceeds and the amount of any  deductible  as
provided in  Subparagraph  1(b) above.  If Tenant  determines in its  reasonable
discretion  that the Leased  Premises may be operated as a viable  economic unit
following such casualty,  then this Lease shall continue until the expiration of
the Term of this Lease.

     3. Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, all insurance proceeds shall
be paid to Tenant.  Tenant shall apply the proceeds to the costs of  restoration
of the Leased Premises.

     4. Any work required to be performed by Tenant under this Article, shall be
made subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article 10.

     5. There shall be no abatement or reduction of fixed net rent or additional
rent  payable by Tenant under this Lease nor any  diminution  of any of Tenant's
obligations under this Lease by reason of any such damage or destruction, nor by
reason of any work  required to be performed by Tenant under this  Article,  nor
shall  Tenant be  entitled to  surrender  possession  of the Leased  Premises by
reason  thereof;  and Tenant  hereby  waives  all  rights to such  relief now or
hereafter conferred upon it by any Law now in existence or hereafter enacted.

     6. If any  dispute  shall arise  regarding  any matter  arising  under this
Article,  such dispute shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the
provisions of Article 37.

     7. Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary set forth in this Article, and
for purposes of this Article  only,  the holder of any Fee Mortgage or Leasehold
Mortgage shall not be permitted to retain any insurance  proceeds,  or otherwise
direct  the  payment  thereof  for any  purpose  other than in  connection  with
performing the work required under this Article.

                                ARTICLE FOURTEEN

                                  CONDEMNATION

or proceeding is pending, and any agreement in lieu of or in anticipation of the
exercise of the power of eminent  domain between  Landlord and any  governmental
authority authorized to exercise the power of the eminent domain.

be apportioned to the date of termination.

     3.   (a) In case of a Taking of fifty  percent (50%) or less of the  Leased
Premises (a "Partial  Taking"),  Landlord and Tenant  mutually shall  determine,
within sixty (60) days after the Vesting Date,  whether the  remaining  premises
(after  the  "Restoration"  defined  in  Subparagraph  5 of this  Article 14 and
elsewhere in this Article) can economically  and feasibly be used by Tenant.  If
Landlord and Tenant  cannot agree upon such matter,  it shall be  determined  by
arbitration  under the  provisions of Article 37. If it is determined  either by
mutual  consent or by  arbitration  that the remaining  Leased  Premises  cannot
economically and feasibly be used by Tenant,  this Lease shall terminate and the
Rents should be apportioned to the date of termination.

          (b) If it is  determined  either by mutual  consent or by  arbitration
that the  remaining  Leased  Premises can be  economically  and feasibly used by
Tenant,  this Lease shall  continue in full force and effect as to the remaining
portion  of the  Leased  Premises  subject  to a  reduction  in the Base Rent as
provided in Subparagraph 6 of this Article 14 hereof.

     4.   (a) In the event of any condemnation not resulting in a termination of
this Lease, the net condemnation award proceeds shall first be made available to
pay for the cost of  Restoration,  to restore the portion of the Leased Premises
not affected by the Taking, to an economically  viable  architectural  unit. Any
excess proceeds after payment for Restoration shall be paid to Landlord.

          (b) In the event of a condemnation resulting in a termination of this
Lease,  the net proceeds  after  deducting  all costs and  expenses  incurred in
connection  with the  prosecution  of such  proceedings  and  collection of such
award,   including   reasonable  attorneys  fees  and  disbursements  (the  "net
condemnation proceeds"),  shall be payable to Landlord, except that Tenant shall
be  entitled  to  bring a  separate  action  for an  award  or  payment  for the
condemnation of Tenant's FF&E or for relocation or moving expenses  provided the
amount of the net proceeds  payable to Landlord with respect to its fee interest
is not diminished.

     5. If, in case of a Partial Taking, this Lease shall not terminate, Tenant,
at Tenant's  expense,  shall commence and proceed with  reasonable  diligence to
repair or reconstruct  the Leased Premises to a complete  architectural  unit as
nearly as possible in character  and  appearance  as existed prior to the Taking
(all of such  repair or  reconstruction  being  referred to in the is Article as
"Restoration"),  provided  that if the cost of  Restoration,  as  estimated by a
licensed reputable, independent contractor approved by both Landlord and Tenant,
shall  exceed the net amount of the award  available to pay  Restoration  costs,
Tenant may, at its election,  terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord
given within forty-five (45) days after receipt of such estimate unless Landlord
agrees to pay the  amount in excess of the award  available  to pay  Restoration
costs. The amount of the net condemnation  proceeds required to pay for the cost
of  Restoration  shall be paid to Tenant and Tenant shall apply such proceeds to
the  payment  of the costs of the  Restoration.  Any net  condemnation  proceeds
remaining after such Restoration shall be payable to Landlord.

     6.   (a) In the case of a Partial Taking, if the  Lease is not  terminated,
then the Base Rent payable  under this Lease for each lease year  (prorated  for
any period  less than a year) from and after the date of the  Vesting,  shall be
reduced by an amount  equal to the product  of: (i) the "Base Rent"  payable for
such lease years multiplied by (ii) a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall
be the amount of rentable square feet in the Leased Premises after giving effect
to the Taking,  and (y) the denominator of which shall be the amount of rentable
square  feet in the  Leased  Premises  prior  to the  Taking;  in  each  case as
determined by the Real Estate Consultant,  to the extent permitted by Law, as if
the  Leased  Premises  were free and clear of this  Lease  (the  "Taken  Portion
Fraction").  "Real Estate  Consultant"  shall mean or any real estate consulting
firm, with at least ten (10) years experience in the Somerset County real estate
market,  acceptable  to Landlord and Tenant,  and if Landlord and Tenant  cannot
agree on the selection of the Real Estate Consultant,  then such selection shall
be submitted for determination by arbitration under Article 37 of this Lease.

          (b) Any  net  condemnation  proceeds  resulting  from a Partial Taking
whether or not this Lease is terminated, shall be disbursed first to pay for the
Restoration of the Leased Premises as provided in Section  14.4(a)  hereof,  and
the balance to Landlord except that Tenant shall be entitled to bring a separate
action for an award or payment  for the  condemnation  of  Tenant's  FF&E or for
relocation or moving expenses provided the amount of the net proceeds payable to
Landlord with respect to its fee interest is not diminished.

<PAGE>

     7.   (a) In the  event of a  Taking  of all or any  portion  of the  Leased
Premises for temporary  use, the  foregoing  provisions of this Article shall be
inapplicable thereto, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect without
reduction  or  abatement of Base Rent and Tenant alone shall be entitled to make
claim for, recover and retain any award recoverable in respect of such temporary
use  whether  in the form of  rental  or  otherwise.  If the  award is made in a
lump-sum  covering a period  beyond the  expiration  of the Term,  Landlord also
shall be  entitled  to make  claim  for and  recover  the  portion  of the award
allocable to such period. If the award is made in a lump-sum covering the entire
period or  substantially  the entire period of such  temporary  use, or shall be
payable  in  periodic   installments   other  than  monthly  or  more   frequent
installments,  such award  shall,  to the  extent  reasonably  determined  to be
necessary  (assuming  investment  at the then  current  rate of  obligations  of
similar  terms  backed  by the  full  faith  and  credit  of the  United  States
government) to pay Rent thereafter accruing during such temporary Taking period,
be paid to  Landlord  by the Taking  authority,  and Tenant  shall so direct the
Taking  authority,  and shall be  credited  against  the  payment  of Rent as it
becomes  due.  Any balance  shall  belong to and be paid to Tenant to the extent
that it does not relate to any period beyond the  expiration of the term of this
Lease.

          (b) If any portion of the award for such temporary use is intended  to
cover the cost of  Restoration  of the  Leased  Premises  or to  making  repairs
occasioned by or resulting  from such  temporary use, such portion shall be paid
to Tenant to cover the cost of  Restoration;  and any  balance  remaining  shall
belong to and be paid to Tenant.  However, if such temporary use shall terminate
after the  expiration of this Lease,  Landlord  shall be entitled to retain such
balance of the award intended to cover the cost of Restoration  and Tenant shall
not be entitled to any part thereof.

     8. In the  event of a Taking  of all or a portion  of the  Leased  Premises
during the Term,  Landlord shall select the attorney to protest the condemnation
proceedings. The settlement of such proceedings shall be subject to the approval
of Landlord.

     9. The Landlord  and Tenant  shall  cooperate to maximize the amount of the
condemnation  award. It is the intent of the parties hereto that where permitted
under law, claims in any condemnation proceeding which either party is otherwise
entitled to submit, shall be submitted as separate claims. Nothing in this Lease
shall be deemed to prevent  Tenant from making a separate claim for moving costs
and the value of fixtures, furnishings and equipment which Tenant is deprived of
as a result of a Taking.

                                -----------------

     1. Tenant shall be in default hereunder if (a) Tenant fails to pay when due
Base  Rent and any other  sums due  under  this  Lease  and such  failure  shall
continue  for more than  thirty (30) days after  receipt of written  notice from
Landlord to Tenant,  or (b) Tenant fails to observe and perform any of the other
terms, covenants and/or conditions of this Lease and such default shall continue
for more than thirty (30) days after receipt of written  notice from Landlord to
Tenant or, if such  default  cannot by its nature be cured  within  thirty  (30)
days,  Tenant's  failure to commence  work thereon  within  thirty (30) days and
diligently prosecute same to completion.

     2. Upon default by Tenant, Landlord may:

          (a)  terminate  this  Lease,  re-enter  the Leased  Premises  and take
possession  thereof and remove all persons  therefrom,  and Tenant shall have no
further claim or right hereunder; or

          (b) bring  suit for the  collection  of Base  Rent and other  sums due
under this Lease when and as such sums are  payable  under this  Lease,  without
entering  into  possession  of the  Leased  Premises  or  canceling  this  Lease
(however, Landlord shall use its best efforts to mitigate its damages); or

<PAGE>

          (c) if  Landlord  terminates  this  Lease as a result of a default  by
Tenant,  Landlord  shall then have the right,  at any time,  at its  option,  to
require  Tenant to pay to Landlord,  on demand,  as liquidated  and agreed final
damages in lieu of Tenant's liability under clause (b) above, an amount equal to
the  difference  (discounted  to the date of such  demand at an  annual  rate of
interest  equal to the then  current  yield on  actively  traded  United  States
Treasury bills or United States  Treasury notes having a maturity  substantially
comparable  to the  remaining  Term  of  this  Lease  as of  the  date  of  such
termination,  as published in the Federal  Reserve  Statistical  Release for the
week before the date of such termination) between (i) the Base Rent, computed on
the  basis of the then  current  annual  rate of Base  Rent  and all  fixed  and
determinable increases in Base Rent, which would have been payable from the date
of such  demand to the date when this Lease  would have  expired,  if it had not
been terminated,  and (ii) the then fair rental value of the Leased Premises for
the same period  (taking  into account  reasonable  expenses in order to put the
same in proper repair, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements,  reasonable
brokerage  fees and any and all expenses  that  Landlord  would incur during the
occupancy of any new tenant (other than  expenses of a type that are  Landlord's
responsibility under the terms of this Lease)).  Upon payment of such liquidated
and agreed final  damages,  Tenant shall be released from all further  liability
under this Lease with respect to the period  after the date of such demand.  If,
after the default  giving  rise to the  termination  of this  Lease,  but before
presentation of proof of such liquidated  damages,  the Leased Premises,  or any
part  thereof,  shall be relet by Landlord  for a term of one year or more,  the
amount  of rent  reserved  upon  such  reletting  shall be deemed to be the fair
rental  value for the part of the Leased  Premises  so relet  during the term of
such reletting.

     If Landlord defaults in its obligation to pay for the Capital  Improvements
as provided in Article 8, then,  provided Landlord  continues to fail to pay for
such  Capital  Improvements  within  thirty (30) days after  receipt of Tenant's
notice of such  failure,  Tenant  shall have the  right,  as long as there is no
continuing  default by Tenant beyond any applicable  notice and grace period, to
deduct said unfunded amount together with interest at the Interest Rate from the
date of the  failure  to fund  by  Landlord  to the  date of the  offset  herein
provided  against  the next  succeeding  monthly  installment(s)  of Base  Rent,
provided, that, in no event shall Tenant deduct from the Base Rent more than 50%
of the Base Rent due and payable in any month. If the Term of this Lease expires
prior to Tenant's receiving the entire amount payable to Tenant pursuant to this
Article, the balance shall be paid to Tenant on the expiration date of the Term,
together with interest at the Interest Rate from the date of the failure to fund
by Landlord to the date of receipt by Tenant.

     1. If all or any part of the Leased  Premises  is subject to a mortgage  or
underlying  ground lease (an "Underlying  Encumbrance"  and a "Fee Mortgage") at
the time this Lease  commences,  Landlord  shall  obtain from the  mortgagee  or
ground lessor,  as applicable,  and deliver the same to Tenant no later than the
Commencement Date, a non-disturbance agreement in recordable form referred to in
Subparagraph  2  below.  This  Lease  shall  be  subordinate  to the lien of any
Underlying  Encumbrance which may now or at any time hereafter affect all or any
portion of the Leased Premises or Landlord's  interest therein,  provided,  that
Tenant receives from the holder of such Underlying Encumbrance a Non-Disturbance
Agreement  referred to in Subparagraph 2  contemporaneous  with the recording of
the Underlying  Encumbrance.  Tenant agrees that, within fifteen (15) days after
receipt  of request  from  Landlord,  it will,  from time to time,  execute  and
deliver any  instrument or other  document,  required by any holder or potential
holder of an Underlying  Encumbrance to evidence the subordination of this Lease
and the  interest  in the  Demised  Premises  to the  lien  of  such  Underlying
Encumbrance provided, that, Tenant receives a Non-Disturbance Agreement referred
to in Subparagraph 2.

<PAGE>

     2. A Non-Disturbance  Agreement (a "Non-Disturbance  Agreement") shall mean
an  agreement  from the holder of any  Underlying  Encumbrance  now or hereafter
affecting the Premises,  agreeing that, provided Tenant is not in default of any
of its  obligations  hereunder  beyond any  applicable  notice and cure  period.
Tenant's  occupancy of the Demised Premises shall not be disturbed if Landlord's
interest in this Lease  shall he  foreclosed,  as long as Tenant  attorns to and
recognizes  the holder of said  Underlying  Encumbrance,  as  Tenant's  landlord
hereunder,  in accordance with all of the then executory terms and conditions of
this Lease. Such  Non-Disturbance  Agreement shall be in such form and substance
as the holder of the Underlying  Encumbrance  shall prescribe  provided the same
meet commercially reasonable standards for similar transactions.

     In the event of any litigation arising under this Lease, the non-prevailing
party  shall,  upon demand,  reimburse  the  prevailing  party for all costs and
expenses arising  therefrom,  including  reasonable  attorneys' fees through the
trial and appellate levels.

     Landlord  warrants that, as of the Commencement  Date,  Landlord is the fee
simple  owner and record title  holder of the Leased  Premises,  that it has the
full right,  power and authority to execute this Lease,  that there is (and will
be  throughout  the Term and all renewal  terms of the Lease) legal and physical
access sufficient for Tenant's purposes to and from a public  right-of-way,  and
that there is no  agreement,  restriction,  encumbrance,  easement  or any other
matter  which would limit or reduce any of Tenant's  rights  under this Lease or
which would increase Tenant's obligations.  Also, Landlord warrants that Tenant,
upon paying the Base Rent and performing and observing the terms,  covenants and
conditions  of this  Lease  on  Tenant's  part  to be  performed,  Tenant  shall
peaceably and quietly have,  hold and enjoy the Leased  Premises during the Term
of this Lease.

     Landlord  shall  have the  option  ("Landlord's  Construction  Option")  to
construct additional  buildings (each an "Additional  Building") not attached to
the Improvements on any portion of the Leased Premises ("Landlord's Construction
Pad") and to expand the  Building,  provided  Landlord  complies with all of the

     1. In the event Tenant wishes to expand the Building or lease an additional
building on the Leases Premises (the "Expansion Premises"),  Tenant shall notify
Landlord  ("Tenant's  Expansion  Notice") and provide  Landlord  with a detailed
description of Tenant's requirements and of the expansion space Tenant wishes to

receipt of Tenant's  Expansion  Notice,  Landlord  shall notify  Tenant  whether
(i)Landlord is willing to build the Expansion Premises,  and if so, the rent and
other business terms upon which Landlord will build the Expansion  Premises,  or
(ii)  Landlord  is not  willing to build the  Expansion  Premises.  If  Landlord
notifies  Tenant that  Landlord is willing to build the  Expansion  Premises and
Tenant  accepts the terms  offered by Landlord,  then  Landlord  shall build the
Expansion Premises and Landlord and Tenant shall amend this Lease to reflect the
parties  agreement and to detail  Landlord's  construction  obligations  and all
additional terms and conditions upon which Landlord shall build and Tenant shall
lease the Expansion  Premises.  If Tenant does not accept Landlord's offer, then
Landlord shall have no obligation to build the Expansion Premises.

to build the  Expansion  Premises,  then  Tenant,  at its option,  may build the
Expansion Premises at Tenant's cost and expense and the Expansion Premises shall

Expansion Premises,  then Tenant shall submit to Landlord for approval plans and
specifications  showing Tenant's  construction of the Expansion Premises,  which
plans and specifications  shall be subject to Landlord's consent,  which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

                                  INTERFERENCE
                                  ------------

     Landlord  shall not use any  portion of  Landlord's  properties  in any way
which  interferes  with the  operations of Tenant.  Such  interference  shall be
deemed a material breach by Landlord, and Landlord shall have the responsibility
to terminate  said  interference.  In the event any such  interference  does not
cease promptly, Tenant shall have the right, in addition to any other right that
it may have under this Lease, at law or in equity,  to enjoin such  interference
or to terminate this Lease.

                              ARTICLE TWENTY-EIGHT

                              ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
                              ---------------------

     1. Tenant agrees to comply with all  Environmental  Laws in connection with
its use and  operation  of the Leased  Premises.  In the event that any spill or
discharge  of a Hazardous  Substance  in the Demised  Premises in  violation  of
Environmental  Laws is  caused  by  Tenant's  use and  occupancy  of the  Leased
Premises,  or then Tenant,  at its sole cost and expense,  shall  remediate  the
Hazardous  Substance in compliance with  Environmental  Laws (as defined below).
Such  remediation  shall occur  within  ninety (90) days after  Tenant  receives
notice of such spill or discharge,  provided,  that, if the  remediation  cannot
occur within such ninety (90) day period,  Tenant shall have such longer  period
of time as is reasonable to remediate the discharge,  provided that it commences
such remediation within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the discharge
and,  thereafter,   diligently  pursues  such  remediation  to  completion.  Any
remediation by Tenant shall be performed by an environmental company approved by
Landlord in its reasonable discretion. Landlord also expressly acknowledges that
Tenant, in connection with its business  activities at the Leased Premises,  may
bring to the Leased Premises quantities of cleaning supplies, as well as oil and
batteries  (lead  and  otherwise)  used in  connection  with  the  operation  of
vehicles; provided, however, that Tenant shall abide by applicable Environmental
Laws. Tenant will hold Landlord harmless and indemnify Landlord against and from
any  damage,  loss,  expense or  liability  resulting  from any and all  claims,
damages,   losses,   expenses,    liabilities,    fines,   penalties,   charges,
administrative or judicial proceedings and orders,  judgments,  remedial action,
enforcement  actions of any kind (and all other costs and  expenses  incurred in
connection therewith) resulting from a breach of Tenant's obligations under this
Article  28,  including,  without  limitation,  all  attorneys'  fees and  costs
incurred as a result thereof through the trial and appellate  levels, as well as
with respect to Hazardous  Substances  located at, in or on the Leased  Premises
which were brought to the Leased Premises by Tenant.

     "Hazardous Substance" shall be interpreted broadly to mean any substance or
material  defined as  hazardous or toxic  waste,  hazardous  or toxic  material,
hazardous  or toxic or  radioactive  substance,  or  other  similar  term by any
federal,  state  or  local  environmental  law,  ordinance,  regulation  or rule
presently  in  effect,  as the  same  may be  amended  from  time to  time  (the
"Environmental  Laws");  and it  shall be  interpreted  to  include,  but not be
limited to, any substance  (including,  without  limitation,  pollutants,  lead,
asbestos, radon and petroleum products) which after release into the environment
will or may reasonably be anticipated to cause sickness, death or disease.

     2. Tenant shall deliver to Landlord  within thirty (30) days of its receipt
a true and complete photocopy of any correspondence,  notice, report,  sampling,
test, order, complaint,  citation or any other instrument,  document,  agreement
and/or  information  submitted  to, or received  from any  governmental  entity,
department  or agency in connection  with any  Environmental  Law  (collectively
"Environmental  Correspondence")  relating  to  or  affecting  Tenant,  Tenant's
employees and Tenant's use of the Demised Premises.

     3.  Tenant  shall  give  Landlord  prompt  written  notice  of any spill or
discharge of a Hazardous  Substance  occurring  on the Leased  Premises of which
Tenant has  knowledge  or upon  Tenant's  receipt of a notice of a violation  or
notice of potential or alleged violation of Environmental Laws by Tenant.

     4. The parties' obligations under this Article shall survive the expiration
or earlier termination of this Lease.

                OBLIGATIONS WHICH SURVIVE EXPIRATION OF THE LEASE
                -------------------------------------------------

     The  following  obligations  of Landlord  shall  survive the  expiration or
termination of this Lease:  (a) any obligation  herein permitted to be performed
after  the  end of the  termination  of  this  Lease;  (b)  any  obligation  not
reasonably  susceptible of performance  prior to the  termination of this Lease,
including  but not  limited  to, any  obligation  or  indemnity  resulting  from
Landlord's default or misrepresentation;  and (c) any obligation or indemnity to
be  performed  pursuant  to this  Lease at or before  the end of the Term or any
renewal term which is not so performed.

                                 ARTICLE THIRTY

                                 RENEWAL OPTIONS
                                 ---------------

     1. Tenant shall have the option (the "First  Renewal  Option") of extending
the Term of the Lease for one (1) additional  term of five (5) years (the "First
Renewal Term") by notifying (the "First Renewal Notice")  Landlord in writing of
its  intention to exercise the First  Renewal  Option no later than one (1) year
prior to the  expiration of the original Term (the  "Primary  Term").  If Tenant
fails to notify  Landlord of its election to exercise the First  Renewal  Option
prior to the date  referred  to above,  Tenant will be deemed to have waived its
right to exercise  the First  Renewal  Option  pursuant to this Article 30, time
being of the essence with respect to the giving of such notice.  Tenant's  right
to exercise the First Renewal Option shall be conditioned on Tenant not being in
default in the payment of Rent beyond any  applicable  notice and grace  periods
(excluding  any item of Rent which Tenant is contesting  and is not obligated to
pay prior to the  contest) as of the date of its  exercise of the First  Renewal
Option. The terms and conditions of the First Renewal Term will be as follows:

          (a)  The  First  Renewal  Term  will  commence  immediately  upon  the
     expiration of the Primary Term and shall expire at midnight on the last day
     of the sixtieth (60th) calendar month thereafter.

          (b) The annual Base Rent for the First  Renewal Term will be an amount
     equal to the annual  "Fair  Market  Rent" (as defined in Paragraph 3 below)
     for the Leased  Premises then being leased and occupied by Tenant as of the
     start of the First Renewal Term.

          (c) Except as modified by this paragraph,  all provisions of the Lease
     will be equally applicable during the First Renewal Term, except that there
     will be no further First Renewal Option.

     2.  Tenant  shall also have the option  (the  "Second  Renewal  Option") of
extending  the Term of the Lease for one (1)  additional  term of five (5) years
(the "Second Renewal Term") by notifying (the "Second Renewal Notice")  Landlord
in writing of its intention to exercise the Second  Renewal Option no later than
one (1) year prior to the  expiration of the First Renewal Term. If Tenant fails
to notify  Landlord of its election to exercise the Second  Renewal Option prior
to the date referred to above, Tenant will be deemed to have waived its right to
exercise the Second  Renewal  Option  pursuant to this Article 30, time being of
the  essence  with  respect  to the  giving of such  notice.  Tenant's  right to
exercise the Second  Renewal  Option shall be conditioned on Tenant not being in
default in the payment of Rent beyond any  applicable  notice and grace  periods
(excluding  any item of Rent which Tenant is contesting  and is not obligated to
pay prior to the contest) as of the date of its  exercise of the Second  Renewal
Option. The terms and conditions of the Second Renewal Term will be as follows:

          (a) The  Second  Renewal  Term  will  commence  immediately  upon  the
     expiration  of the First  Renewal  Term and shall expire at midnight on the
     last day of the sixtieth (60th) month thereafter.

          (b) The annual Base Rent for the Second Renewal Term will be an amount
     equal to the annual Fair Market Rent (as defined in  Paragraph 3 below) for
     the Leased  Premises  then being  leased and  occupied  by Tenant as of the
     start of the Second Renewal Term.

<PAGE>

          (c) Except as modified by this paragraph,  all provisions of the Lease
     will be equally  applicable  during the Second  Renewal  Term,  except that
     there will be no further Second Renewal Option.

     3. "Fair  Market Rent" shall mean the amount of Rent a new tenant would pay
for comparable space in the Building for each twelve (12) month period occurring
during the First Renewal Term and Second Renewal Term (as applicable),  or if no
figures are  available,  then for  comparable  space in a similar  building in a
similar  location in the Somerset,  New Jersey area,  determined as set forth in
Paragraph  4 below.  Whenever  "Fair  Market  Rent" is  determined  pursuant  to
applicable  provisions of this Lease, the determination shall also be made as to
the  extent  of  tenant  improvement  allowances,  brokerage  commissions,  rent
abatements or  concessions  or other benefits which would be made available to a
new tenant (or  otherwise  paid to a new tenant or other third party) under then
market conditions for renewal tenants. Notwithstanding the above, however, in no
event shall the "Fair Market Rent" for the first twelve (12) months of the First
Renewal Term (or for any subsequent twelve (12) month period),  or for the first
twelve (12) months of the Second Renewal Term (or for any subsequent twelve (12)
month period), as applicable, ever be less than the annual Base Rent payable per
square feet within the Building under this Lease for the last twelve (12) months
of the Primary Term (as to both the First  Renewal  Term and the Second  Renewal
Term).

     4. After  receipt by Landlord of Tenant's  First  Renewal  Notice or Second
Renewal Notice, as applicable,  Landlord and Tenant will have a period of twenty
(20) days  within  which to agree on the Fair  Market  Rent for each twelve (12)
month period occurring during the First Renewal Term and the Second Renewal Term
(as  applicable).  If Landlord and Tenant agree on the Fair Market Rent for each
twelve (12) month period  occurring during the First Renewal Term and the Second
Renewal Term (as applicable),  then they shall immediately  execute an amendment
to this Lease  stating the agreed upon amount equal to the Fair Market Rent (for
the First Renewal Term) and the Fair Market Rent (for the Second  Renewal Term),
as applicable.  If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree for any reason on the
Fair Market Rent for each twelve (12) month  period  occurring  during the First
Renewal Term and the Second Renewal Term (as applicable) within said twenty (20)
day period, then the parties agree that the current Fair Market Rent (as to that
twelve (12) month period in which any such dispute occurs) will be based upon an
amount as  determined  by a board of three (3)  licensed  real  estate  brokers.
Landlord  and Tenant  shall each  appoint one (1) broker  within  seven (7) days
after  expiration  of the twenty (20) day period,  or sooner if mutually  agreed
upon,  satisfying the  requirements  set forth below. The two so appointed shall
select a third  within  seven (7) days after they both have been  appointed  (if
they are unable to do so, the same shall be  appointed  by a court of  competent
jurisdiction  by motion of either  Landlord  or Tenant).  Each  broker  shall be
licensed in New Jersey as a real  estate  broker,  specializing  in the field of
commercial leasing in Somerset,  New Jersey,  having no less than ten (10) years
experience in such field,  and recognized as ethical and reputable within his or
her  field.  Each  broker,  within  seven (7) days  after  the  third  broker is
selected,  shall submit his or her  determination of the Fair Market Rent (as to
that twelve (12) month  period in which any such  dispute  occurs).  The current
Fair  Market Rent (as to that  twelve  (12) month  period in which such  dispute
occurs) for  purposes of this Lease shall be the mean of the two closest  rental
rate  determinations.  In arriving at their  individual  determinations  of Fair
Market Rent for each twelve (12) month period occurring during the First Renewal
Term and the Second Renewal Term (as applicable), each broker shall consider the
standard  set  forth  in  Paragraph  3 above  and  shall  also  analyze  all the
components of the Lease, and apply to them the current market factors.

                                 EXISTING LEASE
                                 --------------

     1. The  parties  acknowledge  that  Tenant  currently  has  certain  rights
(including  the right of  possession)  with respect to the Leased  Premises (the
"Existing  Premises")  being leased pursuant to the "Existing Lease" (as defined
below),  which  rights are derived from and/or in  connection  with that certain
Agreement  of Lease dated  December  11, 1967 (the  "Existing  Lease").  In this
regard,  simultaneous with the Commencement Date of this Lease,  Tenant shall no
longer have any rights and/or interests in the Existing Premises pursuant to the
Existing Lease and, in this regard,  both Landlord and Tenant hereby acknowledge
and confirm the following:  (i) simultaneous  with the Commencement Date of this
Lease,  the Existing Lease shall  automatically  terminate (the "Existing  Lease
Termination Date"), and (ii) notwithstanding the execution of this Lease and the
termination  of the  Existing  Lease (as  stated  above) on the  Existing  Lease
Termination  Date,  Landlord  and Tenant  shall  remain  liable and  responsible
pursuant to the Existing Lease for those  obligations  payment(s)  which accrued
prior to the Existing Lease  Termination Date.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary  which  may be set forth in the  Existing  Lease,  Tenant  shall not be
required  (and  Landlord  does hereby  forever  waive any such  requirement)  to
restore all or any portion of the Existing  Premises  and/or to remove any items
from the Existing Premises.

                            -----------------------

     Within 10 Business  Days after  written  request by Landlord,  Tenant shall
execute  and  deliver to  Landlord  a bargain  and sale deed  without  covenants
against  grantor's  acts  with  respect  to  those  parcels  (collectively,  the
"Outparcels")  shown on the survey  attached  as Exhibit  "E"  attached  to this
Lease. All transaction  costs  associated with such conveyance  (excluding legal
fees) shall be borne by Landlord  and upon  delivery of said deed,  Tenant shall
have no further  obligations  with respect to the  Outparcels and Landlord shall
deliver a general release to Tenant relating to the Outparcels.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS
                               ------------------

     1. Merger.
        -------
     The  parties  agree  that  they  have not made any  commitment,  statement,
promise or agreement  whatsoever,  verbally or in writing,  which is in conflict
with the terms of this  Lease,  or which in any way  modifies,  varies,  alters,
enlarges or invalidates any of its provisions.  This Lease sets forth the entire
understanding  between the  parties and may not be changed or amended  except in
writing.

     2. Governing Law.
        --------------
     This Lease will be  construed in  accordance  with the laws of the State of
New Jersey.

     3. Drafting Presumption.
        ---------------------
     If there  is any  ambiguity  in this  Lease  it will  not be  construed  in
accordance  with  any  presumption  against  Tenant  as a result  of its  having
initially drafted this Lease.

     4. Invalidity of Particular Provision.
        -----------------------------------
     If any  provision  of this  Lease or  application  of it to any  persons or
circumstances  is, to any  extent,  held to be  invalid  or  unenforceable,  the
remainder  of this Lease,  or the  application  of such  provision to persons or
circumstances  other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable,
will not be  affected,  and  that  provision  of this  Lease  will be valid  and
enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

     5. Estoppel Certificates.
        ----------------------
     (a) At any time and from  time to time,  upon not less  than ten (10)  days
prior  notice  from  either  party to the other  party,  the other  party  shall
execute,  acknowledge  and deliver to the  requesting  party a statement (or, if
such other party is an entity,  an  authorized  person of such other party shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver a statement) certifying, to its best knowledge,
the following:  (i) the  Commencement  Date,  (ii) the  expiration  date of this
Lease, (iii) the date(s) of any written  amendment(s) and/or  modification(s) to
this Lease,  (iv) that this Lease was properly executed and is in full force and
effect without amendment or modification, or, alternatively, that this Lease and
all amendments and/or modifications  thereto have been properly executed and are
in full force and effect,  (v) the current annual Base Rent, the current monthly
installment of Base Rent and the date on which  Tenant's  obligation to pay Base
Rent commenced, (vi) the date to which Base Rent and Impositions have been paid,
(vii) that all Capital  Improvements have been completed in accordance with this
Lease, except as specifically provided in the estoppel certificate,  (viii) that
no installment of Base Rent has been paid more than thirty (30) days in advance,
or, if so,  specifying such, (ix) whether Tenant is in arrears in the payment of
any Base Rent,  (x) whether  either party to this Lease is in default  beyond an
applicable  grace  period  in the  keeping,  observance  or  performance  of any
covenant,  agreement,  provision  or  condition  contained  in this Lease and/or
whether an event has occurred which, with the giving of notice or the passage of
time,  or both,  would  result in a  default  by the other  party,  and,  if so,
specifying the  nature of  the  default, (xi)  whether  Tenant has any  existing

<PAGE>

defenses,  offsets,  liens,  claims or credits  against the Base Rent, or, as to
either  party,  against  enforcement  of this  Lease by  Landlord,  and,  if so,
specifying the nature of the same,  (xii) whether Tenant has received any notice
of  violation  of  legal  requirements  relating  to the  Premises  and,  if so,
specifying  the  nature of any such,  (xiii)  whether  Tenant has  assigned  its
interest  in this  Lease or its  interest  in all or any  portion  of the Leased
Premises, (xiv) whether Tenant has unlawfully generated, manufactured,  refined,
transported,  treated,  stored,  handled,  disposed  or  spilled  on the  Leased
Premises  any  Hazardous  Substances,  and  (xv)  any  other  matter  reasonably
requested by the party requesting the estoppel certificate,  provided, that such
items  shall be to the best  knowledge  of the party  delivering  such  estoppel
certificate.  Each party hereby  acknowledges and agrees that such statement may
be relied upon by the other party's lender or prospective purchaser, assignee or
subtenant of its interest in this Lease, in the Leased Premises,  or any portion
thereof.  Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary:  (A) if any estoppel
certificate  conflicts  with the terms and  provisions  of this Lease,  then the
terms and  provisions  of this  Lease  shall  control,  and (B)  delivery  of an
estoppel certificate shall not waive any rights or remedies of the party signing
same.

          (b) Landlord agrees that it shall not request an estoppel  certificate
from the Tenant  unless it is  required  by a holder or  potential  holder of an
Underlying  Encumbrance  or in  connection  with a sale  or  refinancing  of the
Demised  Premises.   Tenant  agrees  that  it  shall  not  request  an  estoppel
certificate  unless it is  necessary in  connection  with (i) an  assignment  or
sublet  of the  Leased  Premises,  (ii) a sale of  Tenant,  or (iii)  bankruptcy
proceedings regarding Tenant.

     6. Reasonableness.
        ---------------
     Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Lease,  whenever  Landlord's
or Tenant's  consent,  approval or agreement is required  under this Lease,  the
parties agree to act reasonably and in good faith.

     7. Broker.
        -------
     Landlord and Tenant  represent  and warrant one to the other that they have
not had any dealings with any real estate broker,  salesperson,  firm, finder or
similar agent in connection  with the  negotiation  of this Lease.  In addition,
Landlord  hereby agrees to indemnify  and hold Tenant  harmless from and against
any and all liability  and cost which Tenant may suffer in  connection  with any
real estate brokers,  salespersons,  finders,  firms or other party claiming by,
through, or under Landlord, seeking any commission, fee or payment in connection
with this Lease.  Tenant hereby  agrees to indemnify and hold Landlord  harmless
from and against any and all  liability  and cost which  Landlord  may suffer in
connection with any real estate brokers,  salespersons,  finders, firms or other
party  claiming  by,  through or under  Tenant  seeking any  commission,  fee or
payment in connection with this Lease.

     8. Memorandum of Lease.
        --------------------
     Landlord  agrees to  cooperate  with Tenant in  executing  and  recording a
Memorandum of Lease reasonably  acceptable to Tenant evidencing  Tenant's rights
under this Lease and/or Tenant's use of the Leased Premises.

     9. No Merger.
        ----------
     In no event  shall  the  leasehold  interest,  estate  or  right of  Tenant
hereunder  merge with any  interest,  estate or rights of  Landlord in or to the
Leased Premises,  it being understood that such leasehold  interest,  estate and
rights of Tenant  hereunder  shall be deemed to be separate  and  distinct  from
Landlord's   interest,   estate  and  rights  in  or  to  the  Leased  Premises,
notwithstanding that any such interests,  estates or rights shall at any time or
times be held by or vested in the same person, corporation or other entity.

     10. Waiver of Trial by Jury.
         ------------------------
     To the extent  permitted by law,  Landlord and Tenant hereby waive trial by
jury in any litigation brought by either of the parties hereto against the other
on any  matter  arising  out of or in any way  connected  with this Lease or the
Leased Premises or the buildings and improvements thereon.

     11. Successors and Assigns.
         -----------------------
     This Lease  shall be binding  upon and shall  insure to the  benefit of the
parties, their respective successors, personal representatives and assigns.

<PAGE>

     12. Holding Over.
         -------------
     If Tenant, or any assignee or subtenant of Tenant, holds over possession of
the Leased  Premises  beyond the expiration  date of the Term, such holding over
shall not be deemed to extend the Term or renew  this  Lease,  but such  holding
over shall  continue  upon the terms,  covenants  and  conditions of this Lease,
except that Tenant  agrees that the charge for use and  occupancy  of the Leased
Premises,  for each  calendar  month or portion  thereof  that Tenant holds over
shall be a liquidated sum equal to  one-twelfth  (1/12th) of one and one-half (1
1/2)  times the Base Rent  required  to be paid by Tenant  with  respect  to the
Leased  Premises,  during the Lease Year preceding the  expiration  date for the
first  sixty  (60) days of the  holdover  and two (2) times such Base Rent after
such sixty (60) day period.  Such tenancy  shall  continue  until  terminated by
Tenant or until Landlord shall have given Tenant at least thirty (30) days prior
to the intended date of termination,  written notice of intent to terminate such
tenancy,  which  termination date must be as of the end of a calendar month. The
parties  recognize  and agree that the  damage to  Landlord  resulting  from any
failure by Tenant to timely surrender  possession of the Leased Premises will be
extremely  substantial,  will exceed the amount of the monthly Base Rent payable
hereunder and will be impossible to accurately  measure.  If the Leased Premises
are not  surrendered  within seven (7) days after the  expiration of this Lease,
Tenant shall indemnify and hold harmless  Landlord against any and all losses it
may incur resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any claims made by
the succeeding  tenant founded upon such delay provided:  (i) Landlord  delivers
notice to Tenant that it has an executed  lease with another tenant and that the
tenant under the executed  lease has a  termination  right if Landlord  fails to
deliver the Demised  Premises to Tenant by a certain date, and (ii) the holdover
by Tenant  continues for the longer of sixty (60) days after the date this Lease
expires or thirty (30) days after  Landlord  delivers  to Tenant  notice of such
signed lease. Nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed as a consent by
Landlord to the occupancy or possession by Tenant of the Leased  Premises beyond
the expiration  date of this Lease,  and Landlord,  upon said  expiration  date,
shall be entitled to the benefit of all legal  remedies that now may be in force
or may be hereafter enacted relating to the immediate repossession of the Leased
Premises.  Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, take all actions required
to remove any assignee or sublessee of Tenant, or other party claiming rights to
the Leased  Premises  under or through  Tenant  upon the  expiration  or earlier
termination  of the Term.  The  provisions  of this  Article  shall  survive the
expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

     13. Nature of Landlord's Obligations.
         ---------------------------------
     Anything  in the Lease to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  no  recourse  or
relief  shall be had under any rule of law,  statute or  constitution  or by any
enforcement of any assessments or penalties or otherwise, based on or in respect
of this Lease (whether for breach of any obligation,  monetary or non-monetary),
against  any  individual  or  entity  comprising  Landlord,   including  without
limitation,  the members,  partners,  directors,  trustees,  and/or  officers of
Landlord or of such members,  partners,  or trustees of Landlord (the foregoing,
collectively,  "Landlord  Exculpated  Parties")  with  respect  to  any  of  the
provisions of this Lease. It being  expressly  understood that Tenant shall look
solely to the estate and  property of Landlord  in the Leased  Premises  and the
rents, issues,  profits, awards and proceeds (whether cash proceeds are received
in connection with a sale,  financing,  refinancing,  condemnation or insurance)
therefrom.  No other property or assets of the Landlord Exculpated Parties shall
be  subject  to  levy,  execution  or  other  enforcement   procedures  for  the
satisfaction  of  tenant's  claim  under  or with  respect  to this  Lease,  the
relationship  of Landlord  and Tenant  hereunder,  or Tenant's  occupancy of the
Leased  Premises:  such  exculpation  of personal  liability  to be absolute and
without any exception  whatsoever.  In the event  Landlord  transfers all of its
interest  in the Leased  Premises,  and  provided  that any such  transferee  or
assignee  shall have  executed and  delivered to Tenant an  assumption of all of
Landlord's  obligations  under this Lease,  the  Landlord  herein named shall be
automatically freed and relieved from and after the date of such transfer of all
liability  as  respects  the  performance  of any of  Landlord's  covenants  and
agreements arising thereafter under this Lease, and such assuming  transferee or
assignee  shall be thereafter  automatically  bound by all of such covenants and
agreements,  it being intended that Landlord's covenants and agreements shall be
binding on Landlord,  its  successors  and assigns only during and in respect of
their  successive  periods of such ownership,  provided,  however,  that no such
transfer of interest in the Leased  Premises  Property or any part thereof shall
relieve  Landlord  of  liability  under  this Lease for any  obligation  arising
hereunder  prior to such  transfer.  This Section 13 of Article 33 shall survive
the  expiration  or sooner  termination  of this  Lease  and shall  inure to the
benefit of Landlord's  successors  and assigns and their  respective  directors,
officers, shareholders, partners, trustees and member.

                               ------------------

     1.  (a) Tenant may mortgage or pledge its leasehold  interest in and to the
Leased  Premises  under  this  Lease  ("Leasehold  Mortgage"),  and assign it as
collateral security for a loan or loans for any purpose whatsoever,  without the
prior written consent of Landlord,  provided only that the following  conditions
are complied with:

                    (i)  Tenant is not then in  default  under the terms of this
               Lease beyond the expiration of the applicable grace period.

               subordinate  to  all  the   agreements,   terms,   covenants  and
               conditions  of this  Lease,  subject  to the  provisions  of this
               Article  34, and such  Leasehold  Mortgage  shall be subject  and
               subordinate to any Mortgage;  provided,  however, that the holder
               of such  Leasehold  Mortgage shall be entitled to the benefits of
               the Non-Disturbance Agreement(s) as provided in Article 17;

                    (iii) a copy of any such Leasehold  Mortgage and the note or
               bond secured thereby shall be delivered to Landlord within thirty
               (30) days after the execution and delivery thereof; and

                    (iv)  any  such  Leasehold  Mortgage  is made to and for the
               benefit of an Institutional Lender.

         (b) Any loan or loans made by a Leasehold  Mortgagee  and secured by  a
Leasehold  Mortgage shall be upon such payment terms as Leasehold  Mortgagee may
require.

     2.  (a) If the holder of any Leasehold Mortgage ("Leasehold Mortgagee"), or
any affiliated  designee or nominee  thereof,  acquires the leasehold  estate of
Tenant pursuant to this Lease,  either through enforcing its remedies under such
Leasehold  Mortgage  or directly  from  Landlord  pursuant  to this  Lease,  the
Leasehold  Mortgagee or its affiliated designee or nominee may thereafter assign
or transfer this Lease as provided in Article 11.

         (b) No Leasehold Mortgagee shall become liable under this Lease unless
and until it becomes the owner of the leasehold estate hereunder,  and then only
for  liabilities  first  arising  after  taking  ownership;  and such  Leasehold
Mortgagee  shall be relieved of any liability  under this Lease arising from and
after the effective date of an assignment by Leasehold Mortgagee of its interest
herein.

     "Institutional  Lender"  shall  mean shall  mean a bank,  savings  and loan
association,  insurance  company,  trust  company,  college or university  fund,
pension fund of a public corporation listed on a national  securities  exchange,
or a Federal, state or municipal pension or retirement fund or a publicly traded
REIT, which makes loans on real estate or personal property fixtures, equipment,
etc., in the ordinary course of such institution's business,  which entity has a
net worth in excess of Five Hundred Million ($500,000,000) Dollars.

     3. (a) If Tenant executes a Leasehold Mortgage and the Leasehold  Mortgagee
sends or  causes  to be sent to  Landlord  a true copy  thereof,  together  with
written  notice  specifying  the  name and  mailing  address  of such  Leasehold
Mortgagee,  then,  in order to be  effective,  a copy of each  notice of default
and/or  termination  given to Tenant  under this  Lease  shall be  delivered  by
Landlord to Leasehold Mortgagee contemporaneously and in the same manner as such
notice  is  delivered  to  Tenant.  Landlord  shall  accept  performance  by the

<PAGE>

Leasehold  Mortgagee within the time specified  herein as timely  performance by
Tenant.  Provided the Leasehold  Mortgagee shall (i) cure within the time period
provided herein any default in payment of Rent, (ii) prosecute the curing of all
other  defaults  in the  performance  or  observance  by  Tenant  of  any  other
obligations,  covenant or  provision  of this Lease  within the  required  grace
period, (iii) continue to timely pay or cause the Rent to be paid as provided in
this Lease,  Landlord shall not exercise any right or remedy provided for herein
which would adversely  affect the right of the Leasehold  Mortgagee with respect
to the use of insurance  or  condemnation  proceeds  and/or the  Landlord's  Tax
Account.  Such default shall be deemed cured and any notice of termination given
by Landlord shall be deemed nullified if, within the prescribed period set forth
above,  the Leasehold  Mortgagee  shall have:  (i) paid to Landlord all past due
Rent and (ii) cured any other  defaults by Tenant  hereunder that are capable of
being cured by Leasehold  Mortgagee  (it being agreed that provided all defaults
curable by Leasehold  Mortgagee are cured and the Leasehold Mortgagee shall have
acquired  possession  of  the  Leased  Premises,  any  defaults  of  Tenant  not
susceptible  to cure by Leasehold  Mortgagee  or its  assignee or designee  (but
excluding Tenant) shall be deemed waived as to such Leasehold Mortgagee).

          (b) Nothing contained  in this Article shall be deemed to require  the
Leasehold  Mortgagee  to commence or continue the cure of any default by Tenant,
or any  foreclosure  or other  proceedings  or, in the event that the  Leasehold
Mortgagee  shall  acquire  possession  of the Leased  Premises,  to  continue in
possession.

          (c) Provided that the Leasehold  Mortgage is in full force and effect,
from and after the date that Landlord receives from the Leasehold  Mortgagee the
noticeset forth in subparagraph (a) above,  Landlord and Tenant shall not modify
or amend the terms,  covenants  and  conditions  of this Lease without the prior
written  consent of the  Leasehold  Mortgagee,  which shall not be  unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

          (d) In case of  termination  of this  Lease by reason of a default  by
Tenant beyond any  applicable  notice and grace  period,  Landlord  shall,  upon
request of Leasehold  Mortgagee  given to Landlord within thirty (30) days after
such  termination,  enter  into a new  lease  of the  Leased  Premises  with the
Leasehold  Mortgagee or with its designee or nominee,  for the  remainder of the
Term,  at the Rent herein  reserved and upon all of the  covenants,  conditions,
limitations  and  agreements  herein  contained.  If  more  than  one  Leasehold
Mortgagee shall request such new lease, then the request of the senior Leasehold
Mortgagee in priority  shall be binding upon the other  Leasehold  Mortgages and
such  new  lease  shall be made  with  and  delivered  to the  senior  Leasehold
Mortgagee (or its nominee or designee)  whose mortgage is prior in lien to those
of any others, as confirmed by written confirmation from a nationally recognized
title company reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, without regard to the time of
request.  Upon  execution and delivery of such new lease,  Landlord shall assign
and transfer to the tenant  under the new lease,  without  recourse,  all of the
Landlord's right, title and interest in and to all subleases theretofor assigned
and transferred to Landlord. Leasehold Mortgagee's right to a new lease shall be
subjec t to the condition  that  Leasehold  Mortgagee or its designee or nominee
shall agree to perform and observe  all of the other  covenants  and  conditions
herein  contained  on Tenant's  part to be  performed  to the extent that Tenant
shall have failed to do so, including the payment of all accrued but unpaid Rent
hereunder, provided same are susceptible of performance by a successor tenant.

          (e) The new lease  granted by Landlord  as  provided  in this  Section
shall  have the same  priority  of title as this  Lease,  subject  to any liens,
encumbrances,  defects  or  deficiencies  created or  suffered  to be created by
Tenant  and any  statutory  liens  which are beyond  the  control  of  Landlord.
Provided  Leasehold  Mortgagee  elects to take a new Lease as  provided  herein,
between  the dates on which the Lease is  terminated  and the new lease  becomes
effective,  not to exceed sixty (60) days,  Landlord  shall not (except in cases
involving what Landlord deems to be an emergency necessitating action) alter the
Leased Premises without the prior written approval of Leasehold Mortgagee,  such
approval  not to be  unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed.  From  and  after  the
effective date of such new lease, Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee or nominee
may assign its interest in the Leased Premises as provided in this Article.

<PAGE>

     4. Landlord and Tenant agree,  for the benefit of any Leasehold  Mortgagee,
that so long as a Leasehold  Mortgage  shall encumber the Leased  Premises,  the
right of election  arising under Section  365(h)(1) of the  Bankruptcy  Code, 11
U.S.C. ss. 365(h)(1) may be exercised by Leasehold  Mortgagee and not by Tenant.
Any exercise or attempted  exercise of such right of election by Tenant shall be
void.

                               TENANT EXCULPATION
                               ------------------

     Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Tenant's
officers,  directors,  employees and shareholders shall not be liable for any of
the obligations of Tenant under this Lease.

                               ARTICLE THIRTY-SIX

                           TENANT'S PATRIOT ACT STATUS
                           ---------------------------

     1. Tenant has advised Landlord that Tenant has been designated as a Patriot
Act Compliant Company ("PAC Company").  Tenant has also advised Landlord that in
order to maintain its status as a PAC  Company,  the parking  areas  serving the
Leased  Premises must be secured in a manner which will ensure that Tenant shall
have exclusive  access to the parking areas and the adjoining areas leading from
the parking area to the loading dock and to the docking areas where Tenant loads
trucks (all of such areas being collectively referred to as the "Secure Areas").
Landlord may not construct or install any public or shared driveway in or around
the  Building  or in any other  location  which  could  affect a Secure  Area or
Tenant's status as a PAC Company.

     2. In the event that Landlord  expands the Building,  Landlord  agrees that
Landlord  shall not take any steps  which may  affect  Tenant's  status as a PAC
Company.  If, in order to expand the  Building,  it is necessary for Landlord to
reconfigure  the Building or the parking  areas,  then  Landlord  shall take all
steps reasonable  necessary at Landlord's sole cost and expense,  to restore the
Leased Premises so that Tenant shall be restored to a PAC Company.

                                   ARBITRATION
                                   -----------

     1.  Wherever  in this  Lease  it is  provided  that any  question  shall be
determined by  arbitration  as provided in this  Article,  or if a dispute shall
arise  between  the  parties  and  Landlord  wishes  to  submit  the  matter  to
arbitration  as herein  provided,  such  question  shall be settled  and finally
determined by arbitration in the County of Somerset and State of New Jersey,  as
follows:

          (a) Landlord and Tenant each shall  appoint an  arbitrator  within ten
days after either of them shall have requested  arbitration.  If either Landlord
or Tenant shall have failed to appoint an arbitrator  within such period of time
and  thereafter  shall  have  failed to do so within a period of five days after
notice by the other party (who shall have  appointed an  arbitrator)  requesting
the appointment of such arbitrator, then such arbitrator shall be appointed by a
Judge or Justice of the highest state appellate court having jurisdiction in the
County in which the  arbitration is to be held. If such Judge or Justice refuses
to appoint an  arbitrator,  he shall be appointed  by the  American  Arbitration
Association or its successor.

          (b) The two  arbitrators appointed  as  above  provided shall select a
third  arbitrator  and if  they  fail  to do so  within  ten  days  after  their
appointment,  such third arbitrator shall be appointed as above provided for the
appointment of an arbitrator where either party fails to do so.

          (c) Each  arbitrator  so selected  shall have at least ten (10) years'
experience in the subject  matter of the dispute,  and no arbitrator  shall be a
person who is or has been an employee of Landlord or Tenant during the five-year
period immediately preceding his appointment.

<PAGE>

          (d) The three  arbitrators,  selected as aforesaid,  shall convene and
commence  hearings within ten days after the appointment of the third arbitrator
and shall proceed to conclude such hearings within a reasonable time thereafter.
The  decision of such  arbitrators  shall be in writing and made within ten (10)
days after the final  hearing  unless such time is extended by  agreement of the
parties to the  arbitration;  and the vote of the  majority of them shall be the
decision  of all and  binding  upon  Landlord  and  Tenant.  Duplicate  original
counterparts  of such decision shall be sent by the arbitrators to both Landlord
and Tenant.

          (e) The arbitrators, in arriving at their decision, shall consider all
testimony and documentary evidence which may be presented at any hearing as well
as relevant facts and data which the arbitrators  may discover by  investigation
and inquiry outside of such hearings.  The parties to the arbitration shall have
the right to be represented by counsel and to cross-examine witnesses.  Landlord
and Tenant  shall each pay the fee of the  arbitrator  appointed by it or on its
behalf  and the fee of its  attorney.  All  other  expenses  of the  arbitration
(including  without  limitation the fee of the third  arbitrator) shall be borne
equally by  Landlord  and Tenant  unless the  arbitrators  shall  decide  upon a
different allocation.

          (f) In the event the arbitrators  shall hold against Tenant's position
taken in the  arbitration  proceeding,  the time of Tenant  to  comply  with the
provision  of this Lease  which  Tenant had failed to comply  with  pending  the
determination  of such  arbitration  shall (provided Tenant shall have otherwise
complied  with all of its other  obligations  under  this  Lease in the  interim
period except,  to the extent permitted by this Lease, any such other obligation
with respect to which an arbitration  proceeding has been commenced) be equal to
any time period  otherwise  provided  with respect  thereto in this Lease (other
than any  obligation  requiring the payment of money,  in which case said period
shall be five (5) Business  Days),  commencing upon receipt of the arbitrato rs'
award.  Tenant's  failure to comply with the matter in dispute prior to the date
of the  arbitrators'  award shall not constitute a default under this Lease, nor
shall Tenant be deemed in default with respect to any matter which is determined
adversely  to Tenant but with respect to which any  applicable  grace period has
not yet expired.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the c ontrary, in the event
a dispute arises  concerning the payment of Rent or otherwise which is submitted
to arbitration, Tenant shall continue to pay Rent claimed by Landlord to be due,
until the matter is  determined  by  arbitration.  If the amount of Rent paid by
Tenant  exceeds  the amount  determined  to have been  payable,  Landlord  shall
promptly reimburse Tenant for such excess amount.

          (g) The  provisions  of this Article shall apply only to those matters
which,  pursuant  to  the  express  terms  hereof,  are  to be  arbitrated.  The
arbitrators  shall have no authority to decide  matters  beyond the scope of the
matters specifically made subject to arbitration hereunder. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, in no event shall any disputes regarding the amount
or payment of Base Rent payable  hereunder be subject to arbitration,  nor shall
Landlord's recourse to summary proceedings be subject to arbitration.

                                   -----------

                     Rent Increase From Capital Improvements
                     ---------------------------------------

Tenant's Base Rent shall be increased as set forth below as of the 1st of month
following completion of the Capital Improvements. The Base Rent shall increase
by the Wiley Additional Monthly Rent calculated as follows:

     A.   Total Cost: The actual cost of the Capital Improvements (not to exceed
          $1,000,000), plus Landlord's financing rate (increased by 50 basis
          points) at the time of the disbursement of the funds by Landlord to
          Tenant. The financing rate shall be agreed upon by Landlord and
          Tenant. If the parties are unable to agree upon the financing rate,
          the rate shall be determined by arbitration pursuant to Article 37 of
          the Lease.

     B.   Useful Life It is the manufacturer's and the supplier's written
          estimate of the Capital Improvements' useful life assuming normal
          maintenance.

     C.   Wiley Remaining Lease Term It is calculated in years, months and days
          from the 1st of the month following completion of the Capital
          Improvements.

     D.   Wiley Share is calculated by multiplying A x (C/B) = D

     E.   Estimated Wiley Additional Monthly Rent calculation for its share:

          D / C (stated in years and fractions thereof) / 12= Estimated Monthly
          Additional Rent

a.   Total Cost: The cost includes the Landlord's financing cost. If we assume
     that the market interest rate is 6% (this of course would vary depending on
     market conditions) and that the useful life of the improvements is 15
     years, then the constant to self-amortize the improvements is 10.13%. Add
     the 50 basis point margin = 10.63% as the financing cost premium.
     Therefore, the calculation of the Landlord's cost is as follows:

            Improvement Costs         $1,000,000
            Times Constant              x 10.63%
                                        --------
            Annual Costs                $106,300
            Time Useful Life             x 15yrs
                                        --------
            Total Cost to Landlord    $1,594,500

            A - $1,594,500

b. Useful Life: Assume 15 Years; therefore

            B = 15 Years

c. Wiley Remaining Lease Term: Assume it is 10 years

            C = 10 Years

d. Wiley Share: A x (C/B) = D; therefore

            A =             $1,594,500
            x C              x 10 yrs.
            /B                / 15 yrs
                              --------

                                   -----------

                 REQUIREMENTS FOR LANDLORD'S CONSTRUCTION OPTION

     A. In the event Landlord elects to exercise Landlord's Construction Option,
Landlord  shall give Tenant written notice  ("Landlord's  Construction  Notice")
advising  Tenant of Landlord's  election and detailing all of the material terms
(including  rent) on which Landlord would lease such  additional  space ("Option
Space") to Tenant.  Tenant  shall  have a period of thirty  (30) days  following
receipt of  Landlord's  Construction  Notice to  determine  whether to accept or
reject  Landlord's  offer with respect to the Option  Space.  If Tenant  accepts
Landlord's  offer, then Landlord shall build the Option Space in accordance with
Landlord's  Construction Notice and Landlord and Tenant shall amend the Lease to
reflect the parties' agreement and to detail Landlord's construction obligations
and all  additional  terms and  conditions  upon which  Landlord shall build the
Option Space and Tenant shall lease the Option Space.

     B. In the event Tenant delivers to Landlord  written notice that Tenant has
elected to reject  Landlord's offer to lease the Option Space or Tenant fails to
respond to  Landlord's  Construction  Notice  within the time  period  specified
above, then Landlord's offer shall be deemed rejected and Landlord shall be free
to lease the Option Space or a portion  thereof to an  unrelated  third party on
the  terms  set  forth in  Landlord's  Construction  Notice  or other  terms and
conditions  which may not be less  favorable to Landlord by ten percent (10%) or
more without the requirement  for  resubmission to Tenant of a revised offer for
the Option  Space.  If the terms are less  favorable  to Landlord by ten percent
(10%) or more,  then  Landlord  must  submit to  Tenant a revised  offer for the
Option Space and Tenant shall have a period of ten (10) days to accept or reject
such revised offer.

     In the event that Landlord does not enter into a lease for the Option Space
within 180 days after the date of Landlord's  Construction Notice, no subsequent
lease of the Option Space or a portion thereof may be made unless the provisions
of this Article are again satisfied.

     C. If Landlord has elected to exercise  Landlord's  Construction  Option by
constructing any structure other than a "Separate  Building" (as defined below),
then Landlord shall give Tenant written notice ("Landlord's  Construction Option
Notice") of such intention,  together with the  preliminary  site plans Landlord
intends to submit for approval to the local governmental  authority,  which site
plans  shall show all parking  areas and all other  intended  improvements  (the
"Other Site  Improvements") on the Leased Premises (the Additional  Building and
the  Other  Site  Improvements  shall,  collectively,  be  referred  to  as  the
"Additional  Improvements"  and all work  necessary to complete  the  Additional
Improvements shall be referred to,  collectively,  as "Landlord's  Work").  (All
items required to be delivered by Landlord with Landlord's  Construction  Option
Notice shall be referred to, collectively, as the "Preliminary Site Plans.")

     D. Tenant shall have sixty (60) days from its receipt of a complete  proper
set of the  Preliminary  Site Plans to approve or  disapprove  the same,  acting
reasonably.  Any disputes between Landlord and Tenant relating to this Paragraph
shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with Article 37 of the Lease.

     E. A  "Separate  Building"  shall mean a building  constructed  by Landlord
which:

               (i) has full vehicle and pedestrian access to and from Landlord's
          Construction  Pad to a publicly  dedicated  right-of-way,  without the
          need to enter upon the entrance ways and parking  areas  servicing the
          existing  Building,  (ii) shall not prevent the existing  Building and
          the balance of the Leased Premises from having full  unencumbered  and
          unimpeded  vehicle  and  pedestrian  access  to and  from  a  publicly
          dedicated  right-of-way,  without  the need to enter  upon  Landlord's
          Construction  Pad,  (iii) has  sufficient  parking for the  Additional
          Building,  as required  by law,  without the need to utilize any other
          parking at the Leased Premises,  (iv) will not cause,  when completed,
          any portion of the existing  Building and/or the balance of the Leased
          Premises to be in  non-compliance  with then existing  law,  rules and
          regulations,  (v) provides for all  utilities  and utility lines to be
          separately  metered  from the balance of the Leased  Premises,  all at
          Landlord's sole cost and expense, and (vi) shall not affect in any way
          Tenant's  status as a PAC Company or any Secure Area or  interfere  or
          otherwise limit any of Tenant's rights granted under the Lease (except
          for  a  restriction  as  to  Tenant's  expansion  rights  due  to  the
          construction of additional  floor area on the Leased  Premises) and/or
          the  use of  the  balance  of  the  Leased  Premises  in  any  respect
          whatsoever  (except for the area on which the Additional  Building and
          Other Site Improvements are located).

<PAGE>

     F.  Before  commencing  any work,  Landlord  shall apply for and obtain all
applicable  building  permits for all of Landlord's  Work. Upon  commencement of
construction of Landlord's Work, Landlord shall diligently continue construction
of Landlord's Work (without  interference to the balance of the Leased Premises)
until  completion in accordance with the Preliminary Site Plans and the terms of
this Lease and, thereafter,  shall promptly obtain the governmental authorities'
certificate of occupancy for the Additional Building and all of Landlord's Work.

     G. In the  event  Landlord  exercises  Landlord's  Construction  Option  by
constructing  an Additional  Building on Landlord's  Construction  Pad, then, in
such  event,  as of the  date  on  which  Tenant  approves  Landlord's  Work  or
Landlord's Work is deemed  approved,  (i) Landlord's  Construction  Pad shall no
longer be  considered a portion of the Leased  Premises  (ii)  Landlord (and not
Tenant) shall be solely  responsible,  at Landlord's sole cost and expense,  for
all  maintenance  of  Landlord's  Construction  Pad,  as  well as for all of the
Additional Improvements, in order to ensure that Landlord's Construction Pad and
all of the Additional Improvements are at all times throughout the term in good,
tenantable  and proper  working order and  condition.  Landlord and Tenant shall
modify the Lease to remove the  Construction  Pad from the Leased  Premises  and
amend any provisions  that should be modified in connection  with the removal of
this Construction Pad.

     H. Landlord shall operate any  Additional  Building in a first class manner
and shall impose  reasonable  regulations on tenants of any Additional  Building
designed to prevent any interference with the operations of other tenants.

     I. Landlord agrees to indemnify,  defend and hold Tenant  harmless  against
any and all loss, damage, claim, demand, liability or expense,  (including court
costs and reasonable  attorneys' fees through the trial and appellate levels) by
reason of any damage or injury to persons  (including  death) or property  which
may  arise  or claim  to have  arisen  as a result  of,  or in  connection  with
Landlord's exercise of Landlord's  Construction Option and/or Landlord's default
and/or Landlord's negligence or willful misconduct or that of Landlord's agents,
contractors,  licensees,  invitees,  employees  and/or  any  other  party  under
Landlord's reasonable control.

     J.  Landlord  and Tenant shall enter into an  agreement  providing  for the
maintenance  obligations of each party with respect to the  Additional  Building
and the Leased Premises,  and such other matters as Landlord and Tenant may deem
necessary, acting reasonably and in good faith.

     K. The  provisions  contained in this Paragraph are binding on the parties'
successors and assigns.

                                  ---------------

The plan is intended to provide the  officers  and other key  colleagues  of the
Company and of its subsidiaries, affiliates and certain joint venture companies,
upon whose  judgment,  initiative and efforts the Company depends for its growth
and for the profitable  conduct of its business,  with  additional  incentive to
promote the success of the Company.


                                III. ELIGIBILITY
                                     -----------

A participant is selected by the CEO and  recommended for  participation  to the
CC, which has sole  discretion  for  determining  eligibility,  from among those
colleagues in key management  positions deemed able to make the most significant
contributions to the growth and profitability of the Company.  The President and
CEO of the Company is a participant.


                    IV. PERFORMANCE TARGETS AND MEASUREMENT
                        -----------------------------------

The CEO  recommends  and the CC  adopts,  in its  sole  discretion,  performance
targets and performance levels for each participant, not later than 90 days from
the commencement of the plan period. No performance  target or performance level
may be modified after 90 days from the commencement of the plan period.

A.   Performance  targets,  comprising one or more financial  goals, are defined
     for each business unit. Each financial goal is assigned a weight, such that
     the sum of the weights of all  financial  goals for a business  unit equals
     100%.

B.   Each participant is assigned  performance  targets for one or more business
     units, based on the participant's position,  responsibilities,  and his/her
     ability  to affect the  results of the  assigned  business  unit.  For each
     participant,  each business unit is assigned a weight, such that the sum of
     the  weights  of  all  business  units  for  a  participant   equals  100%.
     Collectively,   all  business  unit  performance   targets  constitute  the
     participant's plan period objectives.

C.   Each financial goal is assigned  performance levels (threshold,  target and
     outstanding).


                           V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
                              ----------------------

A.     Financial Results
       -----------------
     1.   At the end of the plan period, the financial results for each business
          unit are compared  with that unit's  financial  goals to determine the
          payout for each participant.
     2.   In determining the attainment of financial goals, the impact of any of
          the  events (a)  through  (i)  listed in  Section  7(b)(ii)(B)  of the
          shareholder  plan,  if dilutive  (causes a reduction in the  financial
          result) will be excluded from the  financial  results for any affected
          business unit.
     3.   Award Determination
<PAGE>

          a.   Achievement  of threshold  performance  of at least one financial
               goal of a performance  target is necessary  for a participant  to
               receive a payout for that performance target.
          b.   The   unweighted   payout  factor  for  each  financial  goal  is
               determined as follows:
                    1.   For performance  below the threshold  level, the payout
                         factor is zero.
                    2.   For  performance  at the  threshold  level,  the payout
                         factor is 25%.
                    3.   For  performance   between  the  threshold  and  target
                         levels,  the  payout  factor is  between  25% and 100%,
                         determined on a pro-rata basis.
                    4.   For performance at the target level,  the payout factor
                         is 100%.
                    5.   For  performance  between  the target  and  outstanding
                         levels,  the payout  factor is  between  100% and 200%,
                         determined on a pro-rata basis.
                    6.   For performance at or above the outstanding  level, the
                         payout factor is 200%.


          c.   A participant's  plan-end adjusted restricted  performance shares
               award is determined as follows:

                    1.   Each   financial   goal's   unweighted   payout  factor
                         determined  above times the weighting of that financial
                         goal  equals  the  weighted   payout  factor  for  that
                         financial goal
                    2.   The sum of the weighted  payout  factors for a business
                         unit's  performance target equals the payout factor for
                         that performance target.
                    3.   The        participant's target incentive
                                                times
                                      the business unit weight
                                                times
                              the performance target payout factor
                                               equals
                          the participant's payout for that business unit

                    4.   The  sum of the  payouts  for all  the  business  units
                         assigned  to a  participant  equals  the  participant's
                         total plan-end adjusted  restricted  performance shares
                         award.

          d.   The CC may, in its sole discretion, reduce a participant's payout
               to any level it deems appropriate.


               VI. RESTRICTED PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARD PROVISIONS
                   ----------------------------------------------

          A.   Restricted  performance shares,  equal to a participant's  target
               incentive,  shall  be  determined  at the  beginning  of the plan
               period.  In addition to the terms and conditions set forth in the
               shareholder plan, the restricted period for the plan-end adjusted
               restricted performance shares award shall be as follows:  subject
               to  continued  employment  except as  otherwise  set forth in the
               shareholder  plan, the lapse of  restrictions  on one-half of the
               restricted  performance  shares  awarded  will occur on the first
               anniversary of the plan period end date (April 30, 2010) at which
               time the participant will receive a stock certificate in a number
               of shares equal to one-half of the restricted  performance shares
               awarded with the  restrictive  legend  deleted,  and the lapse of
               restrictions  on the  remaining  half  will  occur on the  second
               anniversary of the plan period end date (April 30, 2011) at which
               time the  participant  will receive a new stock  certificate in a
               number of shares equal to the remaining half with the restrictive
               legend deleted.

          B.   The plan-end adjusted restricted performances share award will be
               compared to the  restricted  performance  shares  targeted at the
               beginning  of the plan  period,  and the  appropriate  amount  of
               restricted  performance  shares will be awarded or forfeited,  as
               required, to bring the restricted performance shares award to the
               number of shares designated as the plan-end  adjusted  restricted

The participant  may be granted a stock option pursuant to the shareholder  plan
at the beginning of the plan period,  representing  another incentive vehicle by
which the participant is able to share in the equity growth of the Company.  The
terms and  conditions  of the award of the stock  option  are  contained  in the

                                  VIII. PAYOUTS

     90 days after the end of the plan period.

B.   In the event of a participant's death,  disability,  retirement or leave of
     absence prior to the plan-end adjusted restricted  performances share award
     being earned, the award, if any, will be determined by the CC.

C.   A  participant  who  resigns,  or whose  employment  is  terminated  by the
     Company, with or without cause before the award is earned, will not receive
     an award.  Exception to this  provision  shall be made with the approval of
     the CC, in its sole discretion.

D.   In  the  event  of  a  participant's  retirement,   all  plan-end  adjusted
     restricted  performances  share  awards  earned,  but not yet vested,  will
     automatically  vest,  and will be paid out in cash based on the fair market
     value on the next  fiscal  year  end,  if  approved  by the CC, in its sole
     discretion.  Any plan-end adjusted restricted performances share award that
     would have been earned by the  participant in the year of retirement may be
     paid out in cash based on the fair  market  value on the next  fiscal  year
     end, if approved by the CC, in its sole discretion.

E.   In the  event  of  constructive  discharge  or  without  cause  termination
     following a Change of Control,  as that term is defined in the  shareholder
     plan, all "target"  restricted  performance shares vest to the participant,
     or at the CC's  option,  payment  will be made of the value of the "target"
     restricted  performance  shares  based  on the  fair  market  value  on the
     effective date of the Change of Control.

F.   A participant who is hired or promoted into an eligible position during the
     plan  period  may   receive  a  prorated   plan-end   adjusted   restricted
     performances share award as determined by the CC, in its sole discretion.

     sole discretion to interpret and administer this plan,  including,  without
     limitation,   all  questions  regarding   eligibility  and  status  of  any
     participant, and no participant shall have any right to receive a payout or
     payment of any kind whatsoever, except as determined by the CC hereunder.

     any amount which may become payable under the plan.

                              II. PLAN OBJECTIVES
                                  ---------------

The plan is intended to provide the  officers  and other key  colleagues  of the
Company and of its subsidiaries, affiliates and certain joint venture companies,
upon whose judgement,  initiative and efforts the Company depends for its growth
and for the profitable  conduct of its business,  with  additional  incentive to
promote the success of the Company.


                                III. ELIGIBILITY
                                     -----------

A participant is selected by the CEO and  recommended for  participation  to the
CC, which has sole  discretion  for  determining  eligibility,  from among those
colleagues in key management  positions deemed able to make the most significant
contributions to the growth and profitability of the Company.  The President and
CEO of the Company is a participant.


                    IV. PERFORMANCE TARGETS AND MEASUREMENT
                        -----------------------------------

The CEO  recommends  and the CC  adopts,  in its  sole  discretion,  performance
targets and performance levels for each participant, not later than 90 days from
the commencement of the plan period. No performance  target or performance level
may be modified after 90 days from the commencement of the plan period.
<PAGE>
     A.   Performance  targets,  comprising  one or more  financial  goals,  are
          defined for each  business  unit.  Each  financial  goal is assigned a
          weight,  such that the sum of the weights of all financial goals for a
          business unit equals 100%.

     B.   Each  participant  is  assigned  performance  targets  for one or more
          business    units   ,   based   on   the    participant's    position,
          responsibilities,  and  his/her  ability to affect the  results of the
          assigned  business unit. For each  participant,  each business unit is
          assigned a weight,  such that the sum of the  weights of all  business
          units for a participant equals 100%.  Collectively,  all business unit
          performance   targets   constitute  the   participant's   plan  period
          objectives.

     C.   Each financial goal is assigned performance levels (threshold,  target
          and outstanding).


                           V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
                              ----------------------

A.   Financial Results
     -----------------
     1.   At the end of the plan period, the financial results for each business
          unit are compared  with that unit's  financial  goals to determine the
          payout for each participant.
     2.   In determining the attainment of financial goals,
          a.   the impact of foreign  exchange  gains or losses will be excluded
               from revenue and business EBITA and business cash flow criteria.
          b.   the impact of any of the events (1) through (9) listed in Section
               4(b)(ii) of the shareholder plan, if dilutive (causes a reduction
               in the  financial  result),  will be excluded  from the financial
               results of any affected business unit.
     3.   Award Determination
          a.   Achievement  of threshold  performance  of at least one financial
               goal of a performance  target is necessary  for a participant  to
               receive a payout for that performance target.
          b.   The   unweighted   payout  factor  for  each  financial  goal  is
               determined as follows:
                    1.   For performance  below the threshold  level, the payout
                         factor is zero.
                    2.   For  performance  at the  threshold  level,  the payout
                         factor is 25%.
                    3.   For  performance   between  the  threshold  and  target
                         levels,  the  payout  factor is  between  25% and 100%,
                         determined on a pro-rata basis.
                    4.   For performance at the target level,  the payout factor
                         is 100%.
                    5.   For  performance  between  the target  and  outstanding
                         levels,  the payout  factor is  between  100% and 200%,
                         determined on a pro-rata basis.
                    6.   For performance at or above the outstanding  level, the
                         payout factor is 200%.

          c.   A participant's payout is determined as follows:
                    1.   Each   financial   goal's   unweighted   payout  factor
                         determined  above times the weighting of that financial
                         goal  equals  the  weighted   payout  factor  for  that
                         financial goal.
                    2.   The sum of the weighted  payout  factors for a business
                         unit's  performance target equals the payout factor for
                         that performance target.
                    3.   The   participant's total annual incentive opportunity
                                                times
                                the participant's target incentive percent
                                                times
                                         the business unit weight
                                                times
                                  the performance target payout factor
                                                equals
                              the participant's payout for that business unit
<PAGE>
                    4.   The  sum of the  payouts  for all  the  business  units
                         assigned  to a  participant  equals  the  participant's
                         total payout.

          d.   The CC may, in its sole discretion, reduce a participant's payout
               to any level it deems appropriate.


                                   VI. PAYOUTS
                                       -------

A.   Payouts will be made within 90 days after the end of the plan period.

B.   In the event of a participant's death,  disability,  retirement or leave of
     absence  prior to  payout  from  the  plan,  the  payout,  if any,  will be
     determined by the CC.

C.   A  participant  who  resigns,  or whose  employment  is  terminated  by the
     Company, with or without cause, before payout from the plan is distributed,
     will not receive a payout.  Exception to this provision  shall be made with
     the approval of the CC, in its sole discretion.

D.   A participant who is hired or promoted into an eligible position during the
     plan period may receive a prorated  payout as  determined by the CC, in its
     sole discretion.


                     VII. ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER MATTERS
                          --------------------------------

A.   The plan will be  administered by the CC, which shall have authority in its
     sole discretion to interpret and administer this plan,  including,  without
     limitation,   all  questions  regarding   eligibility  and  status  of  any
     participant, and no participant shall have any right to receive a payout or
     payment of any kind whatsoever, except as determined by the CC hereunder.

B.   The Company will have no obligation to reserve or otherwise fund in advance
     any amount which may become payable under the plan.

C.   This plan may not be  modified or amended  except with the  approval of the

                                   ---------------

The purpose of the FY 2007 Executive Annual Strategic  Milestones Incentive Plan
is to enable the Company to reinforce and sustain a culture devoted to excellent
performance,  reward  significant  contributions  to the  success of Wiley,  and
attract and retain highly qualified executives.


                                III. ELIGIBILITY
                                     -----------

A  participant  is  selected  by the  President  and  CEO  and  recommended  for
participation to the CC, which has sole discretion for determining  eligibility,
from among those colleagues in key management  positions deemed able to make the
most significant  contributions to the growth and  profitability of the Company.
The President and CEO of the Company is a participant.


                   IV. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES AND MEASUREMENT
                       --------------------------------------

A.   Strategic milestones are non-financial individual objectives over which the
     participant has a large measure of control,  which lead to, or are expected
     to lead to, improved  performance for the Company in the future.  Strategic
     milestones  are  determined  near the  beginning  of the  plan  year by the
     participant,  and approved by CEO or the participant's  manager, if the CEO
     is not the participant's manager.

B.   The  strategic  milestones  for the  President  and CEO  are  reviewed  and
     approved by the CC.

C.   The strategic  milestones for the President and CEO should be appropriately
     reflected in those of all other colleagues at all levels.  Each participant
     collaborates  with his/her  manager in setting  strategic  milestones.  The
     strategic milestones may be revised during the plan year, as appropriate.

D.   The determination of strategic  milestones includes defining a target level
     of performance and the measure of such, and may include defining  threshold
     and outstanding levels of performance and the measures of such.


                            V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
                               ----------------------

A.   Achievement of a participant's  strategic  milestones will be determined at
     the end of the plan year by comparing  results  achieved to previously  set
     objectives.

B.   Each participant's  manager will recommend a summary evaluation level and a
     payout factor for  achievement  of all strategic  milestones,  by comparing
     results  achieved to the previously  set  objectives.  In  determining  the
     payout factor, the overall performance on all strategic  milestones will be
     considered. The President and CEO will recommend to the CC for approval the
     payout factors for all other  participants.  The CC will approve the payout
     factor for the President and CEO.
<PAGE>
Summary evaluation levels and related payout factors are as follows:

Summary Evaluation             Payout factor range
- ------------------             -------------------
< Threshold                    0
  Threshold                    25% - <35%
> Threshold                    =>35% - <50%
< Target                       =>50% - <90%
Target                         =>90% - <=110%
> Target                       >110% - <150%
< Outstanding                  =>150% - <175%
  Outstanding                  =>175% - 200%

C.     Award Determination
       -------------------

                         STRATEGIC MILESTONES PAYOUT AMOUNT
                         ----------------------------------

total annual incentive opportunity X target incentive percent X payout factor
= Strategic Milestones Payout Eligibility

     1.   Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary, the maximum payout, if any,
          a participant may receive is 200% of the target incentive amount.

     2.   The foregoing strategic  milestones payout eligibility  calculation is
          intended  to set forth  general  guidelines  on how  awards  are to be
          determined. The purpose of this plan is to motivate the participant to
          perform in an outstanding manner. The President and CEO has discretion
          under this plan to take into  consideration  the  contribution  of the
          participant,  the participant's  management of his/her  organizational
          unit and other relevant  factors,  positive or negative,  which impact
          the  Company's,  the  participant's  organizational  unit(s),  and the
          participant's  performance overall in determining whether to recommend
          granting or denying an award,  and the amount of the award, if any. If
          the participant is the President and CEO, such discretion is exercised
          by the CC.


                                   VI. PAYOUTS
                                       -------

A.   Payouts will be made within 90 days after the end of the plan year.

B.   In the event of a participant's death,  disability,  retirement or leave of
     absence  prior to  payout  from  the  plan,  the  payout,  if any,  will be
     recommended  by the  President  and CEO to the CC  which  shall  have  sole
     authority for approval of the payout.
<PAGE>

C.   A  participant  who  resigns,  or whose  employment  is  terminated  by the
     Company, with or without cause, before payout from the plan is distributed,
     will not receive a payout.  Exception to this provision  shall be made with
     the approval of the CC, in its sole discretion.

D.   A participant who transfers  between  businesses of the company,  will have
     his/her payout prorated to the nearest fiscal quarter for the time spent in
     each business, based on the achievement of strategic milestones established
     for the  position  in each  business,  and  based  upon a  judgment  of the
     participant's  contribution  to the  achievement of goals in each position,
     including interim revisions, if appropriate.

E.   A  participant  who is  appointed  to a position  with a  different  target
     incentive  percent will have his/her payout  prorated to the nearest fiscal
     quarter for the time spent in each  position,  based on the  achievement of
     strategic milestones established for each position.

F.   A participant who is hired or promoted into an eligible position during the
     plan  year may  receive a  prorated  payout as  determined  by the CEO,  in
     his/her sole discretion, subject to the approval of the CC.


                      VII. ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER MATTERS
                           --------------------------------

A.   The plan is  effective  for the plan year.  It will  terminate,  subject to
     payout,  if any, in accordance  with and subject to the  provisions of this
     plan.

B.   This plan will be  administered  by the  President  and CEO,  who will have
     authority  to  interpret  and  administer  this  plan,  including,  without
     limitation,   all  questions  regarding   eligibility  and  status  of  the
     participant, subject to the approval of the CC.

C.   This plan may be  withdrawn,  amended  or  modified  at any  time,  for any
     reason, in writing, by the Company.

D.   The  determination  of an award and  payout  under this  plan,  if any,  is
     subject to the approval of the President and CEO and the CC. This plan does
     not confer upon any participant the right to receive any payout, or payment
     of any kind whatsoever.

E.   No participant shall have any vested rights under this plan. This plan does
     not constitute a contract.

F.   All deductions and other withholdings  required by law shall be made to the
     participant's payout, if any.

                         the  period  covered  by  this  report,  based  on such

                         Company's  fourth  quarter  in the  case  of an  annual
                         report) that has materially affected,  or is reasonably
                         likely to materially  affect,  the  Company's  internal
                         control over financial reporting; and

                    a.   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
                         the  design or  operation  of  internal  controls  over
                         financial  reporting  that  are  reasonably  likely  to
                         adversely  affect  the  Company's  ability  to  record,
                         process,  summarize and report  financial  information;
                         and
                    b.   any  fraud,  whether  or not  material,  that  involves

               untrue  statements of a material fact or omit to state a material
               fact  necessary  to make  the  statements  made,  in light of the

                    a.   Designed such disclosure  controls and  procedures,  or
                         caused such  disclosure  controls and  procedures to be
                         designed under our supervision, to ensure that material
                         information  relating  to the  Company,  including  its
                         consolidated  subsidiaries,  is  made  known  to  us by
                         others within those entities,  particularly  during the

                    b.   Designed   such   internal   control   over   financial
                         reporting,   or  caused  such  internal   control  over

                         supervision,  to provide reasonable assurance regarding
                         the   reliability   of  financial   reporting  and  the
                         preparation   of  financial   statements  for  external
                         purposes  in   accordance   with   generally   accepted
                         accounting principles;
                    c.   Evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure
                         controls and  procedures  and  presented in this report
                         our  conclusions   about  the   effectiveness   of  the
                         disclosure  controls and  procedures,  as of the end of
                         the  period  covered  by  this  report,  based  on such
                         evaluation; and
                    d.   Disclosed  in this  report any change in the  Company's
                         internal control over financial reporting that occurred
                         during the Company's  most recent  fiscal  quarter (the
                         Company's  fourth  quarter  in the  case  of an  annual
                         report) that has materially affected,  or is reasonably
                         likely to materially  affect,  the  Company's  internal
                         control over financial reporting; and

          5.   The  Company's  other  certifying  officer and I have  disclosed,
               based on our most  recent  evaluation  of internal  control  over
               financial  reporting,  to the  Company's  auditors  and the audit
               committee  of  the  Company's  board  of  directors  (or  persons
               performing the equivalent function):
                    a.   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
                         the  design or  operation  of  internal  controls  over
                         financial  reporting  that  are  reasonably  likely  to
                         adversely  affect  the  Company's  ability  to  record,
                         process,  summarize and report  financial  information;
                         and
                    b.   any  fraud,  whether  or not  material,  that  involves
                         management  or other  employees  who have a significant
                         role in the Company's  internal  control over financial
                         reporting.
