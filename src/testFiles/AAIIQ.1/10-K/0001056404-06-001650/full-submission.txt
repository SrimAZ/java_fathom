Report of Independent Auditors


To the Board of Directors and Stockholder
of JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association:

We have examined management's assertion about JPMorgan Chase Bank, National
Association's (the "Company") compliance with the minimum servicing standards
identified in the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's Uniform Single
Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers ("USAP") solely as they relate to
standard VII, Insurance Policies (the "Applicable Standard"), as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2005 included in the accompanying management assertion.
Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the Applicable
Standard. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion
about the Company's compliance, solely as it relates to the Applicable Standard
based on our examination. The Company uses subservicing organizations to perform
the servicing obligations subject to minimum servicing standards I-VI of USAP.
We did not examine the Company's compliance with standards I-VI of USAP and,
accordingly, do not express an opinion thereon.

Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance
with the Applicable Standard and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company's compliance with the Applicable Standard.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
Applicable Standard solely as it relates to standard VII, Insurance Policies, as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material
respects.
